_electrotrash.co.za_ was started in mid 2005 by Rick Disco and dirtyoldman in order to keep track of all the happenings in the growing South African electronic music scene as no such service was available. We wanted to expose the producers of electronic music, showcase their music and help promote their shows and parties.

Starting small and limited to the Pretoria/Johannesburg area, _electrotrash.co.za_ has grown over time. As we continue to network and make new friends, [new artist profiles](/artists/ "electrotrash Artists") are added regularly and [free downloads](/downloads "electrotrash Downloads") of their tracks are made available. Reviews of shows and albums have been a part of the website from the beginning and with the addition of new writers from different parts of the country, the shows we are able to review have grown.

_electrotrash.co.za_ has undergone a number of facelifts over the years, in order to keep up with the demands of our users. First time visitors are encouraged to join our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/electrotrash.co.za "electrotrash Facebook Page") to stay in touch as well as to contribute to the content we provide. Every visitor is able to add details for upcoming parties amongst other features.

_electrotrash.co.za_ was started to help the scene grow without having a bloated website. We are proud of the fact that we provide free downloads for a large number of artists that represent the broad spectrum of South African electronic music!

We always appreciate feedback and suggestions, so feel free to [contact us](/contact "Contact Us!").

Thank you to all of you for your continued support. We love you all and we hope to achieve many great things in times to come!

Take it easy dirtyoldman, RickDisco and the rest of the electrotrash team. ^5!
