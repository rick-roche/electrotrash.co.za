**Biography:**

As a child, I was not the biggest music fan. I only caught on to the music scene in about 1997, and it was at this stage that I realized that I had hidden musical tastes, instilled without me knowing by my older brother constantly listening to music while I was growing up. So I grew up with this hidden fascination with groups such as Depeche Mode, The Sisters Of Mercy, The Human League and Joy Division. I think I can safely say that my musical interest stems from my childhood exposure to 80’s synthpop.

started my music-making odyssey in the late 90’s, with the early e-Jay programs. I am kind of embarrassed to say that now, but its true. I then discovered Fruity Loops, and my music-making world changed forever. I started making original songs by the bucketload, but they were not really any good (at least to me) as the PC I was working off had a habit of not saving my Fruity Loops mixes, so I had to make all my songs in single sittings… which was tedious to say the least.

I have since gotten a new PC, and now have the ability to save my work, and go back and constantly improve it. I have also started using Reason 3, and my music has never been better.

My style constantly changes, its dependant on my mood… Some days I wake up and make a really chilled, happy song, with upbeat drums and lyrics, and the next day I will end up making a grinding, hissing, growling industrial track. At the moment I am busy working on a way to incorporate all the styles I love making into one: A sort of industrial futurepoppy alternative dance chill music… And I have no idea what I am going to call it… I think I am going to settle on EMOTRONIC…
