**Biography:**

Born and raised in a small, secluded town in the Namibian north, music has always been a way to both escape, and to express myself. I thought myself bit of a pioneer as I brought fresh new music to the few people who really appreciated it. To cut it short, I started out as a small town DJ, Uplifting Trance being my speciality... although, when you're the only DJ in town, you're bound to come across the odd school dance - where you don't get to play what you want.

Afterwards I started dabbling in production. Unfortunately it was with Sonic Foundry's Acid (which came with my brand-new CD writer). It grew old really quickly, as there weren't many samples included. eJay followed. I dropped that quicker than a flaming turd. I wanted to create my own music, not piece it together from other people's samples. Then I discovered Fruity Loops. I created track after (original) track. Some of them were quite successful on the dance floor. Alas, all of them were lost in a fatal hard-drive to cement-floor accident, and the CDs that do exist are somewhere with an ex or in Hong-Kong (don't ask).

When I started studying, producing moved way down in my priority list. Fruity Loops had become too artificial sounding as well. Then one day, a friend introduced me to Reason. That was the turning point. That was the birth of "Compl33t".

Quite a few years had passed, and my taste and perception of music had changed. I found my style of producing had as well. I could sit days on end without being able to compose anything listenable. Then there are those days where I just sit down, and it flows like the most natural thing.

What's the essence of my music? Expression, emotion, experiences, ideals and everything that makes me what I am. My influence is life and everything it gives me.
