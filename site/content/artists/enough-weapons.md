Enough Weapons are an electronic dance production duo putting out glitchy chopped up funky breaks and tech with deep grinding bass lines!

From Cape Town, they've begun an assault on the dance scene and it's hard to find beats that can rock a dance floor quite like these! 12 Years dj-ing and production experience between the two, world travels and experience in genres ranging from breaks and house to psy trance - they thought it best to mesh their talents and platform their skills through _Enough Weapons_.

These two make intelligent, well produced, underground music with a mysterious mass appeal. With the intent to elevate the industry standard, they are pushing the bass lines and going beyond what is considered "the norm"!

Enough Weapons perform as a live act and have a style that can be likened to the Plump DJs and Bloody Beetroots - definitely an exclusive act!
