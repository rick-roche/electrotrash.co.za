**Biography:**

I’ve been interested in making music since I was 11 years old. I would always get bored with music very quickly, and it took something very different to keep me interested. That probably why my favourite bands have always been those that were doing something ahead of their time; like Pink Floyd, Depeche Mode, Pixies and more recently Radiohead, Autechre, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada. When I discovered computer aided music about 4 years ago, I got really excited because now I could put many ideas I had into practice.

I started dabbling in various things like building feedback loops, writing basic music software and experimenting with sampling. I realized pretty quickly the problems with using existing samples and started making all my tracks completely from scratch, recording everything I had in my kitchen and trawling up and down industria with my minidisc. I also started going back to my music routes, playing live guitar, bass, piano and drums into some of my tracks overlaid with sampled pieces.

What I’m really enjoying now is playing with recording techniques like recording a sound, playing it back through speakers in a big open room and re-recording it to capture the natural ambience. Playing with psychoacoustics and spatial perception is also something I’ve found really helpful when putting tracks together. For now I’m just enjoying what I’m doing, and it has given me the opportunity to play overseas and meet some really interesting people. If all goes well, I’ll be producing a track for the new Roots album coming out next year, which I’m extremely excited about.

I don’t think I’ll ever stop making music in one form or another. The music will change constantly and what inspires me has always been what is happening on the fringes. I’ve never been that interested in the mainstream but It's great to see that groundbreaking ideas do eventually filter into popular culture, even if it takes 15 years. You just have to listen out for all that pseudo-glitch stuff on the radio to know what I’m talking about.
