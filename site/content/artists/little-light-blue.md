Little Light Blue is the latest project out of the brain of Jaco Loots. You may remember him from [Oceans & Cities](/artists/oceans-cities/ "Oceans & Cities")... but do not for an instant think that this will be similar. The album took me on a reminiscent journey through the spawn of M83 and Mogwai's back catalogue and all the way home again.

Go and be a fan on Facebook and love this project.. [Here](http://www.facebook.com/littlelightblue)!

Stay tuned for more from Little Light Blue as well as a review from his debut release: _**What We All Use To Imagine**_!
