Born from the mucous that caused the 2008 rolling blackouts Liver has blown rigs from Cape Town to Grahamstown with his dirty wobble heavy style. Part chamber concept, part dankliver and part zim dollar bill, this dude moves through genres like a gang leader in a "fresh fish" prison cell. Resurrected only by certain lunar patterns Liver's sick mixes and dirty skull cracking track selection will make you click your heels with excitement.

Be Scared!
