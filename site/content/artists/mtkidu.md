**Biography:**

Mtkidu is comprised of 3 South African individuals on a collective path of a shared creative consciousness; design(art)/animation/production is what constitutes their collective make up and the Mtkidu TFTD 0.5 project and soon to be released second Album,SHAKAWON are merely the first steps too realizing the physical/tangible manifestation of these ideas and concepts.

Mtkidu is a live beat construct and visual manipulation team, comprised of Murray Turpin (M18J92T), Nicholas Nesbitt (Kidu) and Hayley Junkin (chinxxx(VJ). Mtkidu was formed 3 years ago in the pursuit of a sound and visual language that was both relevant, authentic and experimental. For all intents and purposes, we concentrate on the creation and innovation of a new, dynamic sound/vision in South Africa and as the art galleries and clubs stagnate in white and grey cube commercialism, we will not forget the original purpose and potential of these spaces, for invention and exploration…

The time has come to break the conventional moulds of exhibiting and the traditional parameters of tried and tested media and content. Mtkidu(Team Uncool) approach this in four ways:

1.  Audio manipulation created and performed with our laptop, voices, samplers, kaossilator, various effect units and that Casio keyboard you lost when you were five. This creates the soundtrack to the world we wish to create for the viewer.
2.  Experimentation with live visuals (original visuals presented as simple line animations built in flash, that are controlled live).
3.  Alternative Graphic representation of our visual concepts through mediums such as stickers, stencils, badges, prints, T’s, comics, design, web interactions etc.
4.  Regulate ourselves and our projects through our record label, Art and Design concept consultancy, Team Uncool.

So in a word or 303, that’s us and what we do….for now

Love us.
