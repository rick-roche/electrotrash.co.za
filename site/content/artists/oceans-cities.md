After years of searching, unplanned plans emerged. Being tired of hearing the same songs with the same formulas, music with more politics and trends than notes in their music, all of this couldn’t possible be within the majority of music in our country. There could be no salvation in a business like that. So Oceans and Cities emerged. This music has no face. This music isn’t about trends and fashion. These songs don’t complain or embrace. There are no words, you already know them.. These songs echo with your own voice and thoughts. And it will always be in progress, moulding and shaping the sound, feeding it till there is no more space left and you are left with something. The storm is outside, come in here.
