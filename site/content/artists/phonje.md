**Biography:**

The origin of Phonje can ultimately be traced to one evening in November of 2004. In a shower, to be accurate. After the mentioned shower, the first Phonje track, "int.Ro", was finished, culminating in the release of the Dayview EP a full year later.

My musical history begins in 1996, when I was first introduced to the world of MIDI by a friend from school. I literally spent hours on the piano roll interface, churning out tune after tune; none of which ever saw any light of day. A few years later, in 2000, my focus shifted to tracking; first with ScreamTracker, then Impulse Tracker, something I was hooked on for quite some time. Finally, in 2002 I was introduced to Reason, which has been my tool of choice ever since.

Apparent influences in my music include RÃ¶yksopp, Aphex Twin, Brian Eno, Goldfrapp, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, and probably several more that I can't remember (or be arsed to list), with the result that my music covers a broad range of sounds and moods.

Ultimately, Phonje is my outlet for my "mood music", and an attempt to write with sounds; trying to instill emotions or thoughts into the listener, simultaneously creating easily listenable music.

Future plans include intermittent single releases, with the end goal of a full-length album.
