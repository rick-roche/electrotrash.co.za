'Ricoshay' is a fusion of musical genres, created by two experienced rock musicians. Its members Mark Norrie (former Driverlane vocalist) and Gary Hiebner (former Jimmy 12 Inch guitarist/vocalist) started the project in an attempt to create a sound that is dynamic, experimental and modern.

Big beats, brass sounds, electrifying sonic bass and ska-like guitars lay the foundation for catchy vocal hooks and harmonies. The duo are in the process of completing their debut album and they will be touring nationally, to promote it during 2010.
