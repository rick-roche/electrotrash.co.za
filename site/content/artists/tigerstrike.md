Tigerstrike was born in the summer of 2007. With Raffael (The Sound and formerly New world inside), Jonathan (DJ Orlando Doom) and Brett (formerly Vendetta Cartel) they come from a strong band history ranging from punk to electro. They are 3 people with a shared love for creating music that is pure emotion, synth driven dark indie electro sounds that will make you wanna move. The trio is based in Cape Town and was featured on the December 2008 SL Magazine CD.
