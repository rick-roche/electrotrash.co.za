Having met at the age of 2 in a sandpit it was inevitable that these lifelong friends would one day make music together. Twelv & Thesis are difficult to categorise. They're not your average DJ and MC combo, nor are they simply purveyors of Break-Beat and its brethren. With touches of electro and drum 'n bass a spoonful of glitch, and the ever present tooth rattling bass, one things for sure: they make music designed to be partied to. Best you wear comfy shoes.
