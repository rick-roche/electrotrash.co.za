Witchboy is the  witchhaus alter-ego of Nikhil Singh of THE WILD EYES. Formed in the online vortex of the Witchbook and LOS7 ▲NGLE55 underground, which Mishka Bloglin (alias NATTYMARI) describes as :

> a virtual nanoscene, complete with a mainstream of its own. For a microgenre of music that can probably only boast at most 10,000 worldwide fans, it is  pretty intricate stuff.  As if grown from a petri-dish containing music industry DNA, the little Witch House sub-scene keeps growing at an enormous rate.  ([source](http://mishkanyc.com/bloglin/2011/05/31/reasons-not-to-be-cheerful-pt-6-are-we-alone-again-or/) )

The new Witchboy material can be described as NECRO-ELECTRO, exploring new electronic rhythms forged in the rapidly mutating sphere of the Witchhaus underground. Nikhil Singh is also a published artist, and his recently published graphic novel [SALEM BROWNSTONE](http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2009/salem-brownstone-just-your-usual-art-deco-gothic-fantasy-childrens-book/) is available online and from all good bookstores worldwide. Songs featured on the soundcloud will eventually culminate in a solo release of selected tracks.

[PHANTASMA DISQUES](http://phantasma-disques.blogspot.com/) will shortly be releasing a themed compilation of earlier WITCHBOY material entitled BASEMENT ANGELS.
