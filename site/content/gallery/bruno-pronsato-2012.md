Bruno Pronsato graced our shores with his presence this past weekend playing a show in Jozi and CPT, bring with him is laptop and his own brand of techno/tech-house. Make Believe secured the CT Train Lodge as the venue for the Cape Town leg of the party, an amazing venue nestled on an old train platform between two converted carriages that house the ablution facilities.
