Between the sun and the stars, between the city and the winelands, between live and electronic Synergy Live returns for 3 more days of sight, sound and wonder… Top international acts, local legends, rock gods and rising stars explode across four stages, backed by top class sound, light and stage design – all set against the natural beauty of Franschhoek valley. Set up camp with your friends, and make yourself at home in our pop-up wonderland. And with fun fair rides, movie lounges, comedians, a variety of food options and all the comforts you need, you'll wish you never have to leave.
