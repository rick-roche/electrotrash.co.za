[Jacob Israel](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jacob-Israel/8633358962) finally released his much awaited follow up to _"[My Paper Nautilus](http://www.facebook.com/discography/album.php?aid=10644618318)"_ last week. It is entitled "Birthright" and is available for free download! Jacob classifies the album as "Hard. Electronic. Experimental." on his Facebook page and I would have to say it covers all three for sure! It is a great album showing a more mature and polished Jacob Israel.

The album has to be downloaded in two parts, the links are:

*   [http://www.mediafire.com/?5ln3jlozz0k](http://www.mediafire.com/?5ln3jlozz0k) for Birthright1.rar
*   [http://www.mediafire.com/?5mhylutzced](http://www.mediafire.com/?5mhylutzced) for Birthright2.rar

_In total the download is about 142MB._

A full review of _"Birthright"_ will be up shortly!
