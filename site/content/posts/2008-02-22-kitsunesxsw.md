While this compilation was already released on the 4th of Feb. and has generated a bunch of hype, i still feel the need to write about it just in case YOU haven't heard it or (worse still) of it yet. I really like the album from the opening track till the end. The remix of Yelle's ACDG as a bonus track is a nice touch, but buy the vinyl version and the track appears on the track list. Over at [big stereo](http://this.bigstereo.net/2008/02/01/kitsune-maison-5/) they have a cool little mini-mix to give you a taste of what to expect.

I am talking of course about Kitsuné Maison 5!

Also slightly older news, but Drum 'n Bass DJ Grooverider has been arrested and sentenced to 4 years in a Dubai jail because they found a spliff in his shirt! Read more [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7253514.stm).

After the jump, find out why texas ain't all bad...
