Full description after the jump Sounding out again from the heart of Jozi, the Cafe re-Fuels and accelerates into overdrive with another adrenaline-revving Unsound System beatstream.

Navigating this high-octane night out are Fuel's former Saturday night rhythm-electric specialists Dexterity and Offbeat, who'll fly right at the tail-end of the evening and spin out towards Sunday's heavenly event horizon.

Co-piloting with the Unsound System sex-beat experts are special guests Richard The IIIrd, currently the fieriest proponent of the eclectic aesthetic in town, with slots at all the hottest spots and record resources to match; while Adrian Loveland will ignite the heart of the night is with an aural array that ranges from vocal-laced deepness to electro-infused delirium.
