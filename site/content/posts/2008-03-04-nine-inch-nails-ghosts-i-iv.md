From [nin.com:](http://www.nin.com)

[](http://www.nin.com)Nine Inch Nails presents Ghosts I - IV, a brand new 36 track instrumental collection available right now. Almost two hours of new music composed and recorded over an intense ten week period last fall, Ghosts I - IV sprawls Nine Inch Nails across a variety of new terrain.

Trent Reznor explains, "I've been considering and wanting to make this kind of record for years, but by its very nature it wouldn't have made sense until this point. This collection of music is the result of working from a very visual perspective - dressing imagined locations and scenarios with sound and texture; a soundtrack for daydreams. I'm very pleased with the result and the ability to present it directly to you without interference. I hope you enjoy the first four volumes of Ghosts."

Ghosts I - IV is available in a variety of formats and at various prices. For the cheapskates there is a free download which contains 9 of the 36 tracks as well as a 40 page pdf booklet. For $5 you can get all 36 tracks in a variety of drm-free, digital formats. $10 gets you the 2 disc digipak and finally a $75 is for the Deluxe Edition.
