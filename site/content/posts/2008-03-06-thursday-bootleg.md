Swedish [DJ Copycat](http://www.djcopycat.com) has been releasing his mashups since early 2006. This track features various incarnations of Blue Monday mixed on top of the new Superbass single. The song is fun and even features spoken word! Check out his [post](http://djcopycat.blogspot.com/2008/02/new-smalltown-monday-solution-copycat.html) or download the track [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?1ig2tgxmimv).

For you robots in and around Jozi, don't forget to pull into Fuel Cafe tomorrow for the Unsound System. 40 rond gets you in. Apart from the regulars Richard Da IIIrd and Andrian Loveland (The Fool!) will be spinning up some mad tunes.
