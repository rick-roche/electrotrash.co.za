Splashy Fen is about to kick off in less than 8 hours time and my punk ass is in front of a PC in an office. C'est la vie... The [line-up](http://www.splashyfen.co.za/program.html) includes recent U.S. arrivals Redflecks, Goldfish, Napalma & Kidofdoom. A few more electronic acts would be nice...

At [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/nineinchnails_ghosts_I_IV) you can get the full download of NiN Ghosts I-IV in a variety of high quality formats, legally under the creative commons license! Thank trent...

Sorry for the lack of posts, we've been having issues formatting them properly.Â  It seems embedding flash into a post is just too much for wordpress... (enough geektalk)
