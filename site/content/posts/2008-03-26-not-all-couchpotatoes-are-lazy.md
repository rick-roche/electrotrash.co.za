What do you get when you "Take one Drum n Bass DJ, add an MC with roots in hardcore and punk, have a few tokes, mix in some acoustic blues and jazz and sew it all together with some seriously sweet beats"? Rhymes reminiscent of Everlast with a certain darkness.

CouchPotatoes are Tim, Stef and Scott in studio, while the live act consists of a whole host of local muso's adding to the experience. Tracks such as the _21 Bong salute_ are more tongue in cheek, while _Down_ draws upon a darker place. In anticipation of the album, the Potatoes have released their album UNmastered for FREE on [loadtheshow](http://www.loadtheshow.com/show/CouchPotatoes)!
