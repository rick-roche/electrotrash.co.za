![Redflecks @ Sexy Results](/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/redflecks-show.jpg)

So dirtyoldman and I went off to Jo'burg this weekend for the [Unit.r](/artists/unitr) [Phosphenes](http://www.facebook.com/discography/album.php?aid=10148697817) album launch at Carfax on Friday and then for Sexy Results at the super sexy venue [Lemon8](http://www.lemon8.co.za "Lemon8")! Unit.r banged out a really awesome set even though the crowd was much smaller than I had anticipated! Phosphenes is an awesome album indeed! We will post a review of the album shortly, so stay tuned!

Sexy Results was quite a party... [Five Men Three Missing](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Five-Men-Three-Missing/35057720104?ref=ts "Facebook Fan Page") played a great opening set, followed by [Redflecks](http://www.facebook.com/pages/REDFLECKS/6316749913?ref=ts "Facebook Fan Page") who really stole the show for me. So much energy and stage presence combined with great songs really got the crowd into the party mood. We are sad that Redflecks are back in the USA but so glad we got to watch them perform! Thanks to everyone who made their tour possible and thanks to Riaan from [Canned Applause Records](http://www.myspace.com/cannedapplauserecords "Canned Applause Records") for the show on Saturday!

I have put some photos from Sexy Results up in the [Gallery](/gallery "electrotrash Gallery") (courtesy of Lynn Landman) so go and check them out!

I also want to ask that you join our [facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2261635379 "electrotrash Facebook group") for the site... as many of you will remember we used to send out a newsletter to our users. With the new site, we no longer have users, so we will be using the facebook group to keep in touch of important updates etc. So go on down and [join](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2261635379 "electrotrash Facebook group")!

Thanks for your support!
