> _Directions:_
>
> Leaving Rosebank Mall behind you going along Oxford on your way to Sandton, you turn right into Corlett Drive as you would on your way to the cricket stadium... You keep on Corlett for a while, passing the cricket stadium, going underneath the highway and get to the top of a slight hill with a robot and a big bottlestore on your right. Now as you go over the robots beware that Corlett actually turns into another road and in front of the BP garage you need to take a quick right (and then going left) to get back into Corlett. Go down untill you get to a circle with MIDWAYS MALL in front of you. Go over circle turning right into mall's parking. The Xtreme Bowling Alley is on your left next to a furniture shop.
