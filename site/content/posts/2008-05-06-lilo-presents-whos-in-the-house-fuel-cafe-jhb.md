Where: Fuel Cafe, Newtown, JHB Cost: R50

Parisian DJ Jef K revisits Jozi for a once-off return of Who’s in the House, the popular parties that made us all fall in love with house music.

A prolific traveler and veteran behind the decks, Jef has rocked clubs from Auckland to Atlanta, Shanghai to Chicago and Moscow to Madrid, winning over fans with a fresh, vibrant, sexy style that packs floors and cracks smiles. Expect a sound similar to that found on his incredibly successful My House compilations on French label Distance: low-slung, soulful, deep and dirty. In 1999 Jef started Silver Network with brother DJ Tony Silver, creating a platform for luminaries like Pepe Bradock, Charles Webster, Dixon, Iz & Diz, Kemetic Just, Freaks, Spirit Catcher and Alex Kid. Sub-label Crack&Speed introduced dance floors to the electro-minimal sounds of Freestyle Man, Chloé, Tim Paris, Volga Select, Abe Duque and Naughty.

Jef K is one of house music’s finest, a master DJ with a wealth of experience and an ear that’s always looking out for the new.

Joining him are two local legends: Vinny da Vinci and G-Force. Vinny needs no introduction, the undisputed doyen of deep house and veteran of the scene, and G-Force is the man who’s always pushing the envelope with his passionate commitment to underground beats. It’s a night not to be missed, a sexy celebration of solid grooves and silken sounds.
