Take one part man and one part machine. Mix well and serve piping hot with a garnish of beats and basslines. Serving suggestion: outdoors.

Breaking down the barriers and taking no prisoners, 'Green For Go' is an audio intersection the likes of which KZN has yet to see. A collaboration of many different electronic artists that defy genre or classification, it’s a co-operative affair organised by Durban underground crews TripHazard, NoNoNo!!! and Lightworkx, showcasing the finest in dancefloor sounds. It’s a two-day outdoor electronic experience featuring live acts, producers & DJ’s of various genres, all of whom are top of their game and currently high profile in their own scenes.

• June 14 - June16 • Staged at Tuckers’ Bass Farm, Ifafa, KZN South Coast • Main stage (covered marquee) & Chill area with provision for both hot & cold weather to keep the vibe alive! • Top of the line sound, light and staging • Full range of facilities on site including bars, showers, clean toilets, electrical outlets at campsites and a tasty variety of food to satisfy both veggie & omnivore alike.
