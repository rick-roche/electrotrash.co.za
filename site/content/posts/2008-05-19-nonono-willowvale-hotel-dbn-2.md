Free your mind and your ass will follow - in the name of the jol, the whole jol and nothing but the jol. Because why? Because old school is the new cool.

NoNoNo!!! # 9 takes it back to the roots with a bass-blasting ass-blisterer of an oldschool line up:

FLETCHER (African Dope, Krushed & Sorted) TOINE (Remixer of everything except Celine Dion) SOMEONE (Reclusive electro genius. Unmissable) PAPERBOY (The hardest working man in Durban)

And of course, as always, the ECLECTICA ALLSTARS:

LEO HEDMEKANIK MIXIN VIXIN

Who will dropping a retrosynth-electro-breakbeat-indie-funk-fidget slab of beats and pieces.

Damage - R40 Kickoff - 9PM Willowvale Hotel

Jol! Because why? Everything else is positively timid.
