Those of you that managed to see Redflecks when they toured South Africa will know how fun these folks are! If you didn't manage to buy their EP "The Shiny Part" at the shows, now is your chance to buy the tracks digitally at R7 a piece from Rhythm Records (so thats R42 for the whole thing)! The album can be found in their catalog [here](http://www.rhythmrecords.co.za/store/viewAlbum.asp?idAlbum=851 "Rhythm Records")! Check it.

^5!
