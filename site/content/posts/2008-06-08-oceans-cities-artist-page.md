So a big welcome to [Oceans & Cities](/artists/oceans-cities "Oceans & Cities") as our latest featured artist! You can check out the artist page [here](/artists/oceans-cities "Oceans & Cities"), read a great interview with Oceans & Cities [here](/2008/05/31/oceans-cities-interview/ "Oceans & Cities Interview"), and get some free downloads of his music [here](/downloads "Downloads")!

Oceans & Cities is great music to sit back and relax to and we are looking forward to hearing a lot more from this Capetonian soon!

^5!
