So we've been quietly plotting things, which meant that the blogging side of things were on the back burner. Sorry about that, but these things happen. The good news is that in some new an exciting stuff will be happing from our side soon, which we hope you kids will dig! In the mean time, why not download a few tracks from the music we've been listening too and let us know what you think!

Berlin's queen of minimal, Ellen Alien, has just released her new album _Sool_, which is described as "subtle and misterious". This album is quite different to her previous release which featured Apparat and was almost 'minimal-pop'. _Sool_ is darker and remeniscent of the Ellen Alien of old, while still managing to be something unique. The track _Bim_ is a good example. Click [here](http://media.xlr8r.com/files/downloads/mp3s/Ellen%20Allien%20-%20Bim.mp3) to download \[via [XLR8R](http://www.xlr8r.com/mp3/2008/06/bim)\]. Visit the [BPitch Control page](http://www.bpitchcontrol.de/product/407?PHPSESSID=96aa5e3292bb0b8ad0fbb64e405df771) to stream and/or buy the album.

Another German release, this time on [Gomma](http://www.gomma.de), longtime ET favourite Munk just brought out _cloudbuster_. The first single is _Live Fast Die Old_. The prerelease single features remixes by Juan Maclean, Headman and Maral Salmassi. You can get the latter remix [here](http://www.gomma.de/downloads/munk-live_fast_die_old-maral_salmassi_version.mp3) \[via [tonspion](http://www.tonspion.de/mp3.php?mp3=4778&stil=3&seite=1&order=datum&chars=a)\]. Part two of the _Live Fast Die Old_ remixes features Ed Banger Allstars as well as WhoMadeWho.

The new [CSS](http://www.csshurts.com/) (Cansei Der Ser Sexy) album is to be released soon and will be called _Donkey_. Weird, I know... The band is losing some of its pop-sound on this album and going for a grungier sound, which is appropriate considering they are signed to Sub-Pop. As a teaser they have released the track _Rat is Dead (Rage)_ which you can download [here](http://css.radarmaker.co.uk/). You do have to go through a small signup process in order to download, however it requires only your country and email details, so its pretty painless... Their first single will be Left Behind which you can pre-order [here](http://css.trinitystreetdirect.com/store/page3.asp?suptype=1&t=1&sub_type=3) and is to be released on the 14th of July.

Finally, Sébastien Tellier released the sexy and beautiful album _Sexuality_ earlier this year. For those of you who missed it, be sure to check it out! As an added bonus to those of you who liked it (and as a teaser for those of you who haven't heard it) download the Donovan remix over at [betterPropaganda](http://betterpropaganda.com/old/artist_page.asp?id=1537).

keep it dirty!
