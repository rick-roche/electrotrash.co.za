[Annie](http://www.anniemusic.co.uk/) has one of those voices that you fall in love with as soon as she sings. Her first album _Anniemal_ was well recieved but probably didn't get all the attention it deserved. Long time readers of the 'trash will remember our review of her mix for the DJ Kicks series, which we thoroughly enjoyed! Her next album, called _Don't stop_ is due on the 6th of October but the first single _I know ur girlfriend hates me_ is out now and available for order either from [7digital](http://www.7digital.com/stores/productDetail.aspx?shop=1&pid=268661) as an mp3 or you can preorder the 7"/Vinyl from [HMV](http://hmv.com/hmvweb/simpleSearch.do?searchUID=5562329940899350516&pGroupID=2&adultFlag=false&simpleSearchString=annie&primaryID=2&btnSubmitSearch.x=15&btnSubmitSearch.y=9). You can also preorder _Don't Stop_ from [HMV](http://hmv.com/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=281;1;-1;-1&sku=687048). For those who want a taste of her new sound, which is courtesy of producer RichardX and others, you can download her track _Songs remind me of you_ [here](http://dl.free.fr/n7Q6ddze6/05SongsRemindMeOfYou.mp3) \[via [Pardon my Freedom](http://pardonmyfreedom.blogspot.com/2008/07/where-you-go-i-go-too.html)\].
