KIDOFDOOM have been stunning audiences with their epic-rock repertoire since 2006 and since the successful release of their self titled 2007 album 'Kidofdoom', they have been hard at work re writing their set to include tracks never before played live in Cape Town. Their new material is an essential step towards claiming their genre in this country with a noticeably more developed sound and a thrilling live performance, Kidofdoom are well on their way to establishing themselves as one of the great original South African bands.
