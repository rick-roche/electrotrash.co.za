After almost 3 years of crazy, spazzy, goodness the kids from sovereign academy have decided to call it a day and move on to new projects. From the first party thrown in the depths of Sunnyside, Pretoria to Cape Town tours, they have really done it all! It is fitting then that their last party will be once again held in the 012. The venue is the beautiful and big Capital Theatre in Church Square which has seen some really good times, courtesty of the Sovereign crowd as well others such as electoad.

We here @ the 'trash are gonna be there freaking out on the dancefloor and hope that anyone in the area,  that includes jozi, can make it! Check our events page or their [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=22826877921) for more details.

Bye, bye Panda! We're gonna miss you...
