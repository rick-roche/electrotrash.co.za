Where: cnr Willowvale & Umbilo roads, DBN Cost: R30

I Hear(t) Durban returns on the 9th of August, with more of everything!! 2 sound rigs, new guest dj's, more visuals, more cold beer (or at least we hope so), and you.

DJs:

\-Scissorhands -Renaud 5 -DJ Hung Like a Donkey, Meet Me Round The Back (Rift/Retro's) -Angryknees -Lo Boob Oscillator -Mr Doolittle -Miss Yew -Jet Jungle

In keeping with the tradition of the I<3DBN parties, we'll be selling limited edition T-shirts. This time it's Jaws as seen through the eyes of creative powerhouse, Ross Turpin. (There's just no doubt that the big fish flosses after meals. Immaculate dental hygiene.)

Looking forward to seeing you there. I heart Durban.
