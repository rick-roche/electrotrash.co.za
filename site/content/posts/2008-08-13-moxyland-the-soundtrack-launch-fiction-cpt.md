African Dope Publishing presents a musically diverse event to celebrate the launch of the Soundtrack to Moxyland, Lauren Beukes' cult CT sci-fi novel.

THE ALBUM

In line with the themes of the book, Soundtrack to Moxyland is a 14 track compilation of gritty, futuristic music from Cape Town artists known and new. More info: [www.africandope.co.za/albums/moxyland.htm](http://www.africandope.co.za/albums/moxyland.htm)

THE EVENT

All the DJs on the night produced tracks, or are members of bands featuring on the compilation:

Kill-City-George is the lead singer of SAMA-nominated rock band Taxi Violence Skull & Blood are two members of sleaze punk band Damn Right Boogieman is the lead singer of Nine, the nineties fusion rock band Dank and Mix n Blend are Fiction and Long Street party rocking regulars

With a theme like This Is Not Democracy, expect the djs to do whatever they want, spurred on by phat sound, a generous bar tab, and the nicest people in the city on the floor.

The brand new CD will be available on the night, as will Limited Edition Moxyland Book/CD/Fluffy Toy Collector's Packs.
