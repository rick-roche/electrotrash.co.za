On September 4th, 2008, a very special event is happening at Tings 'n Times in Pretoria.

[Jacob Israel](/artists/jacob-israel "Jacob Israel - Artist Profile") and Louis Minnaar have been invited to Portugal, where they are finalists in the 2008 [Imago international film festival](http://www.imagofilmfestival.com "Imago Film Festival") for the music video for “Her Narnian Horse Analogy” from Jacob Israel's album, “My Paper Nautilus”. The video was created and directed by Louis Minnaar.

Go team!! However, they need our help! They need to get to Portugal.

That is why they are having this party in conjunction with [Levi's Original Music](http://www.levi.co.za/MusicMag/ "Levi's Original Music"), [Oppikoppi](http://www.oppikoppi.co.za) and [Speaker Box](http://www.speakerbox.co.za "Speaker Box") to raise money to get them to Portugal to go represent themselves and the weird music from this little place called South Africa.
