Where: Willowvale Hotel, Willowvale Road, Durban Cost: R40

Free your mind and your ass will follow - in the name of the Jol, the whole Jol and nothing but the Jol!

Five years and ten jols later, NONONO!!! is still dropping beats and taking numbers. Sticking with the formula that caused all the trouble, it's another skipload of electro, fidget, retrosynth, minimal, bigbeat and voodoo breaks to set the Durban night alight.

The side garnish features guest DJ's Scissorhands and Renaud 5 from the I (heart) Durban posse and JHB's own Alternative Flashback representative, JIPS, while the main course is the mouthwatering buffet of delectable Eclectica Allstar delights.
