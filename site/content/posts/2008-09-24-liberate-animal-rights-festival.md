Where: Roxy's, 1st Avenue, Melville, JHB Cost: R50 _(Profits will be used by [Beauty Without Cruelty](http://www.bwcsa.co.za "Beauty Without Cruelty") to further their educational work and donated to various animal-related charities)_

> Building on the success of their 2007 animal rights benefit event at Horror Cafe, Uncaged has teamed up with Beauty Without Cruelty and the SA Vegan Society to host an all-day and night animal rights festival on the 4th of October at Roxy's, one of Joburg's most well-known live music venues.
>
> Conceived as a 'protest within a party', Liberate aims to draw awareness to the unsustainable ways in which humanity exploits members of other species and the often unexpected moral and ecological crises that result from this, and to demonstrate to attendees ways of living in greater harmony with the planet and its inhabitants.

More about the festival after the jump!

**Speakers**: International guest speaker Dr. Steve Best ([www.drstevebest.org](http://www.drstevebest.org "Dr Steve Best")) will be delivering a talk on the inseparability of animals rights, human rights and environmental responsibility; he will be supported by a number of prominent local activists, including Beryl Scott, Chairperson of Beauty Without Cruelty Michele Pickover, the author of Animal Rights in South Africa and Aragorn Eloff of the Vegan Society.

**Films**:

Liberate will host the African premiere of '[Meat the Truth](http://www.meatthetruth.nl "Meat The Truth")', a gripping new documentary on the links between meat consumption and climate change. Best described as 'The Real Inconvenient Truth', this film is definitely not to be missed.

Other animal rights related films will be screened throughout the festival, including the Joaquin Phoenix-narrated '[Earthlings](http://www.earthlings.com "Earthlings")' and various shorts.

**Party**: It's not all films and lectures though - a large number of rock, pop, alternative, folk and electronic bands have volunteered to play on the day, including Jane Rademeyer, The Gin, Hasten the Storm, One Mighty Atom, Owl, Scott Scot & Tryst. We've also got some awesome DJ's lined up.

**Art**: Liberate will showcase a range of emerging creative talent, playing host to a dedicated exhibition space and several animal rights related performances.

**Stalls**: Various members of the local animal rights / activist community will be hosting shops and info-stalls at Liberate, including Animal Rights Africa, BWC, FOR A & CLAW. Delicious and nutritious vegan meals will be served courtesy of the SA Vegan Society and a fully stocked licensed bar will be available throughout the day and night.

**Charity**: Profits will be used by Beauty Without Cruelty to further their educational work and donated to various animal-related charities.
