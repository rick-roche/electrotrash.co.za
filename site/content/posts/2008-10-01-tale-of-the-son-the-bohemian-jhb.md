Where: The Bohemian, Cnr Menton and Park, Richmond, JHB Cost: R30

> In order to inaugurate the crashing together of 2 creative movements (the one sonic, the other collaborative), Deconstruction will be helping facilitate the sublime TALE OF THE SON performance at the Bohemian on Friday the 3rd of October 2008. In support will be an exciting performance by Future Records ... The evening will be punctuated by the nimble handedness of a certain dj experimenter of the GLAMorous variety.
>
> So if you're in the mood for aural and visual treats, come along to the Bohemian for an evening of gluttony and decadence ... Or at least a bit of sushi (figuratively) to break the silence/ sequence
