I have been really slow in getting this post up! A while ago Len Cockraft aka _Hipless Couples_ dropped a track in my inbox. The track is called "_Just FFFuck_" and it's a pretty hard hitting, banging electro track.

Len used to be the drummer for the band "[The Wild Eyes](http://www.thewildeyes.com "The Wild Eyes")", I was a big fan of them, so for me it is awesome to see someone from the band releasing some electro fun! Len is also involved in the [Daydream Nation](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=19622978575 "Daydream Nation") parties that have been taking place at [The Assembly](http://www.theassembly.co.za "The Assembly") in Cape Town. I'm sure you will be hearing more about this swinger in the coming months!
