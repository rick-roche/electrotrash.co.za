_Where:_ Willowvale Hotel, Corner Albert Dlomo & Umbilo Roads, Durban _Cost:_ R40

Sharper than a razor's wit, perkier than Milla Jovovich's nipples after a romp in the snow, NONONO!!! once more lurches into the gloaming that is Durban's nightlife to bring the heathen masses a dose of musical evangelism. Freshly baked from a four-day stretch out at AfrikaBurn and ready to tear a new sonic hole in the fabric of Stone City's underground, The Eclectica Allstars have thrown their lot in with a motley crew of DJ's who will be dishing out a smorgasbord of flavours that includes but is not restricted to 80s and 90s classics, indie, alternative, rock, acid jazz, minimal techno, big beat, breaks, fidget, house, remixes, electro, Japanese noodle pop, sofatech and a whole bunch of other stuff so fresh it doesn't even have a name yet!

**DJ's featured:**

The Eclectica Allstars (Hedmekanik, Mixin Vixin, Leo) Kevin Louw (The Rift, Retro's, CRASH) Jet Jungle (Social Workers) Manoj & VaSun (Lapis Lazuli) One Track Mike (TripHazard Sound System)
