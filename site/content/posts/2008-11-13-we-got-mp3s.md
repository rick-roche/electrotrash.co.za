So [KLIKTRAK](/artists/kliktrak "KLIKTRAK") was kind enough to drop us his latest creations! "Cumuppance" is a lovely little melodic  track, KLIKTRAK is definitely going back to his minimal roots with this one! Then we got "Amadeadlydisco" which is a more housey tune that's very easy on the ears.

Our regular contributor, Hipless Couples, dropped us a remix that he did of Amy Merediths "Runner"!  It's a very interesting track indeed! Check out Amy Meredith [here](http://www.myspace.com/amymeredithmusic)!
