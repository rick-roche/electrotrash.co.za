> Come get down to the tunes of Toby2Shoes and Kid Fonque as we bring you the first episode of Sababa - an event that is designed to make your booty groove.
>
> Expect banging Balkan beats, sultry swing sounds, delicious dub and other selected beats and pieces of the kind of cutting edge sounds that we don't hear enough of on a Joburg dancefloor.
>
> You will have no choice but to get up and get down at this hands-in-the air, bum-everywhere night of complete party mayhem.
>
> JHBLive has rocked the Joburg nightlife scene many times in the past, bringing you huge parties including the Live Inna City series and Hit Me with Music, the massively succesful Bob Marley Tribute Party.
>
> Toby2Shoes From the legendary Balkanology parties to The UK, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania, Italy and all over South Africa, Dj Toby2shoes' mixed bag of worldly beats has left crowds screaming for more...Toby has the innate ability to create a vibe on a dancefloor like no other by inherently feeding off the crowd. The musical moods span the globe, but one has come to expect a frenetic and fabulous set of crazy gypsy beats.
>
> Kid Fonque The Kid hardly needs an introduction. A Jozi dancefloor favourite, Kid Fonque is famous for expertly blending electro, broken beat, samba, house, bossa, nu-jazz, hip-hop, breaks and more into his legendary sets.

> And in case you were wondering, Sababa means 'it's all good', 'no problem', 'everything's cool' or 'schweet'
