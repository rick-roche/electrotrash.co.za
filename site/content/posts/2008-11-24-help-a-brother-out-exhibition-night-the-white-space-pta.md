> For 1 Nite only you have the opportunity to help a brother out (check [blog](http://helpabrotheroutexhibit.blogspot.com/ "Blog") for info if you don't all ready know) by coming to Pretoria and buying amazing artworks donated by super talented artist (out of love) that you get to buy for a crazy R100!
>
> There will be a section of really special works going on auction to raise a little extra $$$ for the brother and some other worthy causes. So bring a little extra cash for that!
>
> There will be Canvas button badges, made with contributions from the artists, as well as postcards, on sale for the night. Limited edition posters of the invite artwork and info from the show will be on sale for a nominal figure.
>
> The AIM is to raise as much money as we possibly can. Anything will be considered a success. But with the amazing work we have and the support so far we know help a brother out is going to be an amazing nite!
>
> Amazing Ethiopian food prepared by Solomon and Mame for you to enjoy, a (cheap) cash bar and live Jazz from FOURSEASONS. They play jazz like it should be played we promise you that!!
