[![](/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/l20911720275_7675.jpg "Third World From the Sun")](/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/l20911720275_7675.jpg)

Long time electrotrash friend [Richard the Third](/artists/richard-the-third/ "Richard The Third") has just finished working on his upcoming album _Third World From the Sun._ The good news is that you will be able to get most of it via [MTN Xploaded](http://www.mtnxploaded.co.za) (not live yet) and you can listen to some of the tracks on his [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Richard-the-Third/20911720275?ref=s).

However, as a favour to us he sent us the dirty disco banger "Dancing with the DJ's Girl" featuring the Tutus (and Desmond). The track features that sexy deep bass that we love along with the unique and catchy vocals of Desmond or is it his Tutus? They only way of getting the full album which includes this track is to go to one of his gigs and beg him for a copy of the album at the DJ Booth.

So in case that doesn't work, or you just never go out but love listening to banging electro here it is:
