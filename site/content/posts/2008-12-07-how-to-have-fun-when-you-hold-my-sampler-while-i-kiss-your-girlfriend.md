So we headed out to the [Go-Go Bar](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=30723927587 "Go-Go Bar") last night to catch [Mtkidu](/artists/mtkidu "Mtkidu"), [Jacob Israel](/artists/jacob-israel "Jacob Israel"), [Richard the Third](/artists/richard-the-third/ "Richard The Third") whilst watching CHINXXX do some visuals... Go-Go bar is a pretty interesting venue, taking kitch decor to a new level. Richard The Third set the mood with a grooving set while more and more people started to arrive. Mtkidu then took to the 'stage' and banged out a whole bunch of new tracks, some classic glitch Mtkidu and some a danceable take on the crazy Mtkidu beats we have come to love! Next up was Richard The Third, playing tracks off of his debut album, [Third World From The Sun](/2008/11/27/richard-the-third-third-world-from-the-sun/ "Third World From The Sun")... I love the album so it was great to see him playing it live off of samplers. Sadly, after Richard was done, the party thinned out considerably and Jacob Israel was met with only a few spectators...

All in all, a great line up, in an odd venue turned out to be an awesome night, and not what I had expected at all! Check out some photo's in our [Gallery](/gallery "electrotrash Gallery"), and be _sure_ to catch the rest of Mtkidu's tour (More tour details [here](/2008/11/26/mtkidu-hold-my-sampler-while-i-kiss-your-girlfriend-sa-tour/ "Mtkidu Tour"))!

^5!
