Capetonian act Haezer has released their first music video! The video is for the track _Sirens In The Night (feat. Jax Panik)_, go have a look at it over [here](http://www.vimeo.com/2481220 "Haezer - Sirens In The Night Video")!

Personally I prefer the song to the video... a pretty easy listening electro punk track... grab it...

We also have a remix Haezer did of the Dirty Skirts track _Witches Bewitch Us_ for you! The remix is a banging rework of the original track, making it synth driven and pretty danceable. Put this on your iPod!
