Where: The Willowvale Hotel, Corner Albert Dlomo & Umbilo Rds, Durban

8 DJ's 3 Dancefloors One Kickass Jol

While all the other jols milk the bling, primp the press and mince the cheese, we just lay it on the line and give you 100% kickass music, straight up, no chaser.

Hey - when you're a lean, mean all-singing, all-dancing carnival machine of nocturnal delights it pays to just get on with the job. As always, we strive to butter you up with a silky-smooth dollop of ice-cool groove that'll leave you begging fo mo. Christ, where did that come from?

And so it is that we bring you:

COCO LOCO - making his second appearance at NONONO!!! (his first was in 2006), the hardest working man in KZN takes this opportunity to play all the twisted tracks he can't air at his usual gigs.

MEANBOY - dropping the finest 4 by 4 beats since way back at CRASH and beyond with a track selection sharper than a razor's wit, Meanboy ranks among the finest mixmeisters your heathen ears will ever hear.

CHEMIKULT - longtime underground stalwart, currently a mover shaker on the Lightworkx crew, dropping a rare as dog's horns Dubstep set.

Hosted by your maitre DJ's, as always:

THE ECLECTICA ALLSTARS - Hedmekanik, Mixin Vixin and Leo, dropping their trademark sets of electrosonic retrosynthetic syncopation

and LAPIS LAZULI - Manoj and VaSun, bringing the sophisticated and progressive sounds you know and love.

**WARNING:**

We don't do deep, we don't do cheese and we do not take requests. If you want deep-fried cheese, get a pizza. If you want requests, get a motherfucking jukebox.
