I hope everyone had a great time bringing in the new year! We kick off 2009 with our first post of the year welcoming [GaZo](/artists/gazo "GaZo Artist Profile") on as our latest artist!

Harmonic computer music? I don't know what to call it... read about GaZo [here](/artists/gazo "GaZo Artist Profile")! He kindly sent along two of his tunes for you to listen to and decide for yourself. Don't forget to check out our [Downloads](/downloads "electrotrash Downloads") section for more free music!
