“One of the first acts to truly jump the great divide between dance and live excitement” - 24.com

"These boys are the next Basement Jaxx, I really believe that" - Pacha MD Danny Whittle

“Make no mistake, these boys are gonna to be BIG! The two multi-instrumentalists captivate the crowd, and have the UK contingent scratching their heads and saying to each other ‘we’ve got to get these boys over to Europe…’ Essential.” - TrusttheDJ.com

“…these two freeform improvisation geniuses from South Africa are a real find. Using classic instruments to bring dance music to life, Dominic Peters and David Poole really are the sh\*t. It’s no wonder that Pacha have signed them up for a residency in Ibiza this summer. Check out their forth coming album Perceptions of Pacha and prepare to be amazed! We Love ‘em!” DJ Mag
