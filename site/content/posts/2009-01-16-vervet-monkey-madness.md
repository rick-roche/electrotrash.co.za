Richard Smith, AKA [KLIKTRAK](/artists/kliktrak "KLIKTRAK"), sent me some groovy tunes from a new project that he is involved in. It's called [Vervet](http://www.vervet.tv/ "Vervet.TV") and they describe themselves as "_monkey-funk-tech-step, a new sound to be added to the nu-rave/indie/glitchcore/electro-revival sound pumping from todays dancefloor speaker stacks_".

Whatever that might mean I think it's pretty damn good. Grab two Vervet tracks below, get some KLIKTRAK from our [Downloads](/downloads "electrotrash Downloads") section as well and then check out the Vervet website [here](http://www.vervet.tv/ "Vervet.TV") and then add their Facebook music page [here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vervet/25643810825 "Vervet Facebook Page")!
