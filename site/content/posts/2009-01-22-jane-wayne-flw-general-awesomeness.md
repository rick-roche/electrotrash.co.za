It seems 2009 is well under way with great parties happening all over the country and loads of new artists coming out of the woodwork and letting us know about themselves!

On that note, check out our two latest featured artists: [Jane Wayne](/artists/jane-wayne "Jane Wayne") and [FLW](/artists/flw).

FLW was kind enough to send us two of his tracks, grab them in the [Downloads](/downloads "electrotrash Downloads") section!

Remember to keep checking out our [Events guide](/category/events "electrotrash Events Guide") so that you don't miss out on anything awesome! If you would like to let us know about a party, fill in the form found [here](/events/submit "Submit Event Information") and let us know! To submit anything else, see the links on the right of the page in the sidebar under the heading "Submit Stuff".

Lastly, if you haven't already, join our Facebook group [here](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2261635379 "electrotrash Facebook Group") and our Last.fm group [here](http://www.last.fm/group/electrotrash.co.za "electrotrash Last.fm Group")!

Thanks for the support Rick Disco ^5!
