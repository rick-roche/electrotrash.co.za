Dubstep isn't the biggest genre in South Africa but [ScarCream](/artists/scarcream "ScarCream") certainly make it a well represented one! A live duo banging out sweet beats with a pounding rhythm, they have been taking Cape Town on and bring them some awesome live beats. Personally, I really like their music and am looking forward to hearing more from them in the future.
