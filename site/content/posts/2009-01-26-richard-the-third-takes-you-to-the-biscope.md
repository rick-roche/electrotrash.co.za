[Richard The Third](/artists/richard-the-third/ "Richard The Third") is a really busy dude when it comes to making awesome music. He dropped me a mail with the details of a mix he did for a project of his under the name of "Biscope"! So now we have even more proof that Cape Town is definitely taking the lead when it comes to dubstep in South Africa!

[Fiction](http://www.fictionbar.com "Fiction Bar, Long Street"), on Long Street, Cape Town, hosts a monthly dubstep party called "[Step Up!](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18162796794 "Step Up Facebook Group")" and you are sure to catch Richard The Third dropping some great tunes in some shape or form. The Step Up! parties have a Facebook group, so why not join it and stay in the loop? Link to the group [here](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18162796794 "Step Up Facebook Group")!

Grab a link to Richard's "Biscope - Step Forward" mix as well as tracklisting after the jump!
