Wow my inbox has just been receiving quite a lot of new South African electronic music the past few days and I've been trying to get to it and more keeps piling in... so I figured, just make one big post with a bunch of new stuff in it!

It also seems that as soon as I go and say that [dubstep isn't the biggest genre in South Africa](/2009/01/24/rub-a-dub-dub-step-with-scarcream/ "He went and said it!"), I get a ton of it thrown at me... not that I'm complaining here! I present to you a couple more dubstep mixes... one mix from Cape Town crew, [ScarCream](/artists/scarcream "ScarCream") and another mix from Jo'burg folks, [INISHI8](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4163682835 "INISHI8")!

\[download#75#nohits\] - about 32 minutes long, 30MB big \[download#79#nohits\] - about 42 minutes and 93MB big

Then [GaZo](/artists/gazo "GaZo Artist Profile") kindly dropped off two more of his easy listening electronica...

\[download#77#nohits\] \[download#78#nohits\]

And lastly, [Jane Wayne](/artists/jane-wayne "Jane Wayne") sent us a lovely little number, featuring Richard The Third!

\[download#76#nohits\]

More to come... stay tuned and don't forget you have until 1 February to vote for your Top 5 electrotrash artists [here](/2009/01/25/who-are-your-top-5-electrotrash-artists/ "Top 5 Artists?")!

^5!
