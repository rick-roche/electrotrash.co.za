MTKIDU!
-------

One hundred and fifty one of youÂ  have cast your vote in our "[Who are your Top 5 electrotrash artists?](/2009/01/25/who-are-your-top-5-electrotrash-artists/ "electrotrash: Who Are Your Top 5 Artists?")" poll. The Top Five are as follows:

1.  [Mtkidu](/artists/mtkidu "Mtkidu")
2.  [Richard The Third](/artists/richard-the-third/ "Richard The Third")
3.  [DJ Lapse](/artists/dj-lapse/ "DJ Lapse")
4.  [GaZo](/artists/gazo "GaZo")
5.  [Jacob Israel](/artists/jacob-israel "Jacob Israel")

Congratulations to you folks! It was awesome to see that a lot of the new artists on the site got quite a few votes as well (special mention to [Haezer](http://www.facebook.com/pages/HAEZER/24353086721 "Haezer on Facebook") and [ScarCream](/artists/scarcream "ScarCream"))... So thank you all for voting. We will have to run this poll again sometime as we have new artists on the site all the time, so stay tuned!
