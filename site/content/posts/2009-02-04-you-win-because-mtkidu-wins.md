Electrotrash favourites, [Mtkidu](/artists/mtkidu "Mtkidu"), figured you love them so they should love you too... and what better way to show love than to give presents! They kindly sent us a new track that will feature on their upcoming album "SHAKAWON" and a comic to accompany it!

Grab the link to the track and read the comic after the jump!

First download the song:

    caption="Mtkidu - The Girl Who Does Not Exist" >}}

Then read the comic!
