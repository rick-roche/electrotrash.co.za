The third installment in Kidofdoom's ongoing Trajectory series will see the audience at Ramfest 2009 travel through space to the remote ice planet "Morgan51" in a unique, audio/ visual experience. Navigating a psychedelic journey through dead space, distorted guitars, asteroid fields, pounding drums, frozen wastes and malfunctioning synths, the story of Trajectory III will be told through lighting by Peter Rodda, live video performance by Ben Rausch and a soundtrack by South Africa's premium instrumental rock band Kidofdoom.
