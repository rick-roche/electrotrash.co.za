So here it is, another bumper addition of brand new South African electronica! First up, a new track from [Oceans & Cities](/artists/oceans-cities "Oceans & Cities"), keeping in his usual ambiant style.

And then lastly we have a new artist, [Shotbeak](/artists/shotbeak "Shotbeak"), up. He kindly sent us a 6 track E.P. as well as a 9 track album for your aural pleasure! Grab a track off each album below as a sampler, and if you like them head over to our [Downloads](/downloads "electrotrash Downloads") section [here](/downloads "electrotrash Downloads") to download both the albums!
