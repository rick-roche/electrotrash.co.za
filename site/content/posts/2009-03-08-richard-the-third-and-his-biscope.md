We mentioned [Richard The Third](/artists/richard-the-third "Richard The Third")'s latest music endeavour a short while ago ([here](/2009/01/26/richard-the-third-takes-you-to-the-biscope/ "Richard The Third Takes You To The Biscope")) and now we have more from this project called "Biscope". Biscope is made up of Richard and his brother who goes by the name of [Twelv](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=7788af88c19a3edbb620e28e1347c667&gid=9986174059 "Twelv: Facebook Group") and they describe the music as "Dub Stepping Urban Beats and Pieces". Personally I love it... let us know if you do too in the comments section at the bottom of the post!
