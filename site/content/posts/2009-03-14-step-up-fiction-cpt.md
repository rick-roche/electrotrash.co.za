Step Up is back again with another great line up for all you dubsters

BINARY Step Up's long lost great has returned to Cape Town and will be destroying the floor with some fresh tunes on wax straight outta London Town.

DANJA For any of you who don't already know Danja, one of DnB's pioneers in Cape Town, now you will have the chance to witness his skills. He will be playing his first much anticipated dubstep set.

dj low dj low has been pumping dancefloors for a good few years now. His little dubstep teaser at 300 AD was enough to get anyone in hearing range excited, so check him out!

ISH Ofcourse you all know Ish our step up resident, after a month break she will be back with some new wax ready to mash up the floor.

MC's
