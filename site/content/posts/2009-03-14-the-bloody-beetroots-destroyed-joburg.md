One week ago, Italian electro giants, [The Bloody Beetroots](http://www.myspace.com/thebloodybeetroots "The Bloody Beetroots") graced us with their presence at the Alexander Theatre in Johannesburg. The show blew my mind completely. Hard beats, loads of punters dancing the night away and just a great vibe in general.

Samantha Hill kindly dropped off some photo's from that night of mayhem! Check them out in our [Gallery](/gallery "electrotrash Gallery") [here](/gallery "electrotrash Gallery")!
