I've been a bit slow this week and nearly let these two awesome tracks slip past me! Two of our most active artists have dropped off yet another track each... here they are:

\[download#96#nohits\] - An awesome synth driven track from [CoDeC](/artists/codec "CoDeC")!

\[download#97#nohits\] - A great remix of an already fantastic track, thanks [DJ Lapse](/artists/dj-lapse "DJ Lapse")! Grab the original [here](http://www.wearephoenix.com "Phoenix")!

^5!
