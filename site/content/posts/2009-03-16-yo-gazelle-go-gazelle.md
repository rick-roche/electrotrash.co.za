![GaZelle CHic AFrique](/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/folder.jpg "GaZelle CHic AFrique")

Another week, another new artist. Not that we're complaining, far from it! GaZelle is our newest artist on the site. Check out the full bio [here](/artists/gazelle/) and visit their MySpace profile [here](http://www.myspace.com/yogazelle). We've also recieved a copy of their album CHic AFrique (thanks!) which we will be reviewing soon. In the mean time listen to two of my favourite tracks off the album.

\[download#99#nohits\] - The reggae roots and dubby influences are evident in this track. Pure Class!

\[download#98#nohits\] - Space Disco :)

aaaand here is their first video for the song 'She Did Me In' also from their album:

Enjoi oi oi!
