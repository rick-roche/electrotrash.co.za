[![Hulk Hop](/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/hulk-hop.jpg "Hulk Hop")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/hulk-hop.jpg)

The folks over at [Chrome Kids](http://chromekids.blogspot.com/ "Chrome Kids") dropped off their latest mix tape in my inbox for your listening pleasure. Here's what they had to say about it:

> It’s with great pleasure that we unleash our brand new Mixtape on your earlobes. Hulk Hop Vs Crunk Rock is stacked full of the meatiest Dubstep, Grime and the kind of bass heavy digital Hip-hop which has a dozen or so tenuous genre titles such as Lazer Bass, Robo Booty, Turbo Crunk and Glitch hop.   Anyone familiar with our Chrome Kids Music blog will know the deal.
