Keeping up with Hipless Lapses, [CoDeC](/artists/codec "CoDeC") sent us his remix of [Tigerstrike](/artists/tigerstrike "Tigerstrike")'s "Disappear". I love his remixes and this one is no exception... In case you are wondering why all the Disappear remixes of late, Tigerstrike are producing their debut EP which should be out sometime soon, I hope, the remixes are part of the parcel!

The original is in our [Downloads](/downloads "electrotrash Downloads") section as well as two other remixes... Enjoy!

FLW also sent us a few of his new tracks... Grab them in the [Downloads](/downloads "electrotrash Downloads") section if you want.

^5!
