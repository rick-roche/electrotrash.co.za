It was brought to my attention that Oceans & Cities have released a new album! The best part is that you can download it for FREE! The posting on [O&C's Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Oceans_Cities/39653895985#/pages/Oceans_Cities/39653895985) is pretty vague so I can't even tell you the name of the album, but I think it might be "BhlackSthone" going on the tags on the mp3's. What I've listened to so far it seems a pretty interesting... Musically the album seems to be more experimental rock as apposed to the down tempo electronicaÂ  that we are used to from O&C.

Either way, go and download it and give it a listen... grab it [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=ad67a9ed8453569faaca48175a79d1c33728b70b6750d792b8eada0a1ae8665a "Oceans & Cities - BhlackSthone")!
