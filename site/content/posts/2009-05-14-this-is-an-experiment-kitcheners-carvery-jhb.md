Where: Kitcheners Carvery (at the Milner Park Hotel), Corner of Juta and De Beer, Braamfontein

We've found a new venue in Braamfontein so we're throwing a party to see what will happen...

A block from tiltt.co.za headquarters, it's the second oldest pub in Jo'burg. Lord Kitchener used to hang out there. Some say he still does. Or at least some of his friends still do. We'll be using them as car guards. Just joking. Real flesh and blood security will be provided.

The line-up: Yoji andrw Data Takashi Sound Sensible Offbeat Dexterity

So come and join us to get rid of the ghosts and help celebrate Grant turning 20 something...
