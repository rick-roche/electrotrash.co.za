While this video may not be new, I thought I'd post it for those of you have not seen it yet. The video was done by [Louis Minnaar](www.myspace.com/louisminnaar) and the song comes off the first [Jacob Israel](/artists/jacob-israel/) album 'My Paper Nautilus' which is available as a free download [here](http://www.chrisus.tv/downloads/mypapernautilus.zip). You can also download his second album, 'Birthright', over [here](http://www.chrisus.tv/downloads/birthright.zip). To find out more about Jacob Israel you can visit him on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Jacob-Israel/8633358962), [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/jacobisrael) or [Chrisus.tv](http://www.chrisus.tv).

Enjoy the weekend kids!
