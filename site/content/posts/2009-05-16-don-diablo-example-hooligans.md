[![Don Diablo & Example](/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dondiabloexample-450.jpg "Don Diablo & Example")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dondiabloexample-450.jpg)

A kind man from [Muzikology B.V.](http://www.muzikology.com/ "Muzikology B.V.") sent me this awesome pre-release. Dutch producer [Don Diablo](http://www.myspace.com/dondiablo "Myspace: Don Diablo") teams up with UK rapper [Example](http://www.myspace.com/leadingbyexample "Myspace: Example") for this one, set to be released soon (on 29 June 2009 I believe)! Here's what the press release had to say:

> [Don Diablo](http://www.myspace.com/dondiablo "Myspace: Don Diablo") and [Example](http://www.myspace.com/leadingbyexample "Myspace: Example") team up for their joint effort "Hooligans", which is set to become the mosh pit anthem of 2009! On remix duties: Noisia, Spor, A1 Bassline, Doorly and the main man Don Diablo himself. Make sure you grab your copy of "Aerodynamic Hooligans" as well, which is a mash-up Don Diablo did of his Hooligans track with elements of Daft Punk's "Aerodynamic" and yes, you know it will work like a MoFo on the floor! Release date: 29.06 (except Australia / North America / Mexico, release dates tbc). Check out the music video here: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH78CezwPOQ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH78CezwPOQ "YouTube: Don Diablo & Exmaple - Hooligans").

The video is pretty rad, so give it a look! They also sent through links to download **SEVEN** different mixes of the track, one of which is a mash-up with [Daft Punk](http://www.daftpunk.com "Daft Punk")'s "Aerodynamic". Grab them below! Grab some album art for the tracks over [here](/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dondiabloexamplehooligans.jpg "Don Diablo & Example - Hooligans")!
