[![DJ Lapse - Empire of the Sun Remix](/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/lapse-eots.jpg "DJ Lapse - Empire of the Sun Remix")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/lapse-eots.jpg)

I think it's safe to say that when it comes to remixes, [DJ Lapse](/artists/dj-lapse "DJ Lapse") has it made! Adding his distinctive flavour to each and every track he waves his remix wand at and they always come out banging!

The latest addition to his remix resum√© is that of _Walking on a Dream_ by [Empire of the Sun](http://www.myspace.com/empireofthesunsound "Empire of the Sun on Myspace"). Adding a catchy bassline to the track and a favourite remix to my collection, be sure to check this one out!
