Our long time friend, [Richard The Third](/artists/richard-the-third "Richard The Third"), kindly sent us all the info you need in order to apply to the academy or simply get a bit more info as to what it's about. Keep reading to find out more...

It's that time of the year again; time to get your thinking caps, because the applications for the Red Bull Music Academy 2010 are well under way.

The next edition of the Red Bull Music Academy will touch down in one of the world's most sprawling musical metropolises: London. From February 7 to March 12, 2010, some of the most original and creative minds in music will come together to share ideas, work on tunes, and perform in the best vibe-filled venues around town.

Are you ready to chase that creative spark and take a step on the road to your new next level? Applications end on July 27, 2009 so best get cracking.

Now for some music. These tracks were made at the Red Bull Music Academy in Barcelona last year and they're a super dope example of what you can get up to while you're at the Academy.

Downloads after the jump!

Firstly there's the tech-house brilliance of Cape Town's Thibo Tazz and Zolcan Breaker. It's strictly for the upbeat dancefloors.

But if you really want to get a taste of the music from the academy and the actual academy itself check out â€˜Analogue' by Ireland Jazz-tech man Rory D, Drum n Bass godfather DJ Zinc and Tom Oberheim, one the pioneers of analogue synthesis. The track is an evocative piece of dancefloor electronica with Tom Oberheim musing about analogue synthesis on top. It's an amazing piece of music that is equal parts floor shaking goodness and a lesson in electronic music history. Grab this while you can:
