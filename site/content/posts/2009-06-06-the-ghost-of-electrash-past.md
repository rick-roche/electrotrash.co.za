So I was just browsing using the [Wayback Machine](http://www.archive.org/web/web.php) on [Archive.org](http://www.archive.org/index.php) and thought it would be fun to see if electrotrash was archived. Turns out it was! You can see what the site looked like from the beginning of March 2006 until January 2008. Although some elements are missing, it's still kinda fun to see how electrotrash has changed (hopefully for the better) over the past few years! Just follow [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://localhost) and you will get a list of dates when our site was archived.

Archive.org is a great site worth checking out, they have free downloads of 'moving images', live audio performances (such as concert rips), a ton of other audio (such as audio books and old radio shows) as well as a large selection of open source books.

In their own words:

> The Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form. Like a paper library, we provide free access to researchers, historians, scholars, and the general public.

so check it out!
