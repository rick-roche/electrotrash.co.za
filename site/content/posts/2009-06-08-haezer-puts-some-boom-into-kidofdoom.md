[HAEZER](http://www.facebook.com/pages/HAEZER/24353086721 "HAEZER on Facebook") is probably my favourite local act at the moment which is why I'm so excited to catch him up in Gauteng live next week! To get you just as excited as I am, here is a bumper post full of HAEZER goodies!

First off is a remix he did of a pretty boring [kidofdoom](http://www.facebook.com/pages/kidofdoom/7541330893 "kidofdoom on Facebook") track... Gotham City (see the video [here](http://www.speakerbox.co.za/content/video.aspx?id=315 "kidofdoom - Gotham City Video on Spearbox")!). He turns it into a synthed up masterpiece that I can't stop listening to!

Then he kindly made a mini-mix to let us know what to expect next week...
