Where: CCHQ Corner of Main and Violet, Fishers Hill

Cost: R20 for pre-sale tickets and R30 at the door

Strawberry Tik: It's something we've all experienced. Medicinal but sweet. Disgusting, yet still amazing in an obscure way. The hooker trying to pick you up on Oxford Road. The deadbeat ex and his drugged-up friends. Bobbing to inane doef-doef music at a trashy moffie club, while fighting the urge to sleep. We've all been there. Well, now it's time to take back the TIK!

On the 20th of June, add some strawberry-flavoured magic to your staple diet, and let's party the night away at the legendary TIK hall that is CCHQ.

Remember, the dress code is 'whatever strawberry TIK means to you' ~ There are no limits! Prizes for best dressed! SpasTIK, fantasTIK and bombasTIK...

Use the wall to request your favourite tracks : we'll be playing "friends' selection" between 12 and 1. Think Deeelite, Boney M, Ace of Base or worse!

R20 for pre-sale tickets from your nearest and dearest administrator and R30 at the door. As Oprah would say, come and "have a light bulb moment" with us xxx

We are also delighted to inform you that we have the pleasure of having 2 of JHB's electro bands playing that night...now for the reveal:

Roosevelt Singleton & Trash Mogul will be playing that night from 10:45! Don't miss a moment of the fun and mayhem...Both the bands will supply you with loads of entertainment and we're not talking about the singing!
