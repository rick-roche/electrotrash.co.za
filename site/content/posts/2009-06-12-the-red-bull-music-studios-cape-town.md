Since its inception almost a year ago, the [Red Bull Studio in Cape Town](http://www.redbullstudioscapetown.wordpress.com "Red Bull Studios Cape Town") has been quietly rocking away to the sounds of some of South Africa's meanest musical might.

Kicking things off with a Class Of Its Own in April last year, the Red Bull Music Academy alumni project that saw the likes of DJ Zinc, Aloe Blac and Joao Pekeno come together for a week to make a mass of late night music, the studio has since then hosted such prolific artists as Inge Beckman and Joao Orecchia, true-school rock bands such as Damn Right and the Plastics, mad electronic masters such as DJ Lapse and the mysterious Moleke Mbembe, South African disco hero Gazelle and initiatives such as the Cape Learning Initiative.

There has also been jam packed discussions with the likes of international artists such as Ninja Tunes warriors DJ Food and minimal techno guru, Butane, where people have been invited to come into the studio to share the love.

As the applications for the Red Bull Music Academy go into full swing, the next big event of the Studio's calendar is the Red Bull Taster - ‘A 3rd World Perspective'.

"A 3rd World Perspective" is a taste of what the Academy is like. For three days and nights, twenty South African music makers will start their day off with a lecture from an international music giant alongside local music titans. They'll then get stuck into some music making in the Red Bull Music Studios. We can't reveal too much at present aside from saying that it's all going down between the 1st and 5th of July 2009.

The best part about it all is that all the content coming through the Red Bull Music Studios in Cape Town will be available on a Red Bull Studios Blog. Mp3 and Video blogging is slowly becoming one of the hottest media for promoting music. It's a straight to the point, very current way of letting people know about music and of course there are always mp3s to download and videos to watch.

To get a taste of what's been going down at the studio, grab this download of [Moleke Mebembe](http://www.myspace.com/molekembembe "Moleke Mbembe on Myspace")'s ‘Killa Kat' featuring [Gazelle](/artists/gazelle/ "Gazelle"). It's a dark slow disco burner:
