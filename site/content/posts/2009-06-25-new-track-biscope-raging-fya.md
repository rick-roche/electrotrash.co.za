Got a new track in from the brothers Rumney... Biscope seems to be growing from strength to strength. This new one is called "Raging Fire"... in Richards own words, this is what it's about: "Cut up funk-soul samples, head-banging hard-as-nails basslines and video game samples sent from the 80â€™s through a nightmarish time-warp machine."

Let us know what you think!
