We are proud to announce a new artist on our site and it is none other than Sibot AKA DJ Fuck! If you haven't heard of Sibot you've probably been living under a rock. He has been part of some of South Africa's greatest acts including Max Normal, The Constructus Corporation, The Real Estate Agents and Playdoe to name but a few. Check out [his profile](/artists/Sibot) in our Artist section and grab a few of his tracks in the [Downloads](/downloads/#sibot) section.

This track is an awesome glitchy track with filthy, kickin' bass line that just begs you to freak out on the dancefloor. Not sure if this is released as a DJ Fuck remix or Sibot, either way it's a bangin' tune worth checkin' out!

MC Spoek, the other half of Playdoe does the vocals on this twichy, fidget track. It's bound to get a few asses shakin'. Get it while it's hot!
