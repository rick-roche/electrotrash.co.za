This track is an awesome glitchy track with filthy, kickin' bass line that just begs you to freak out on the dancefloor. Not sure if this is released as a DJ Fuck remix or Sibot, either way it's a bangin' tune worth checkin' out!

MC Spoek, the other half of Playdoe does the vocals on this twichy, fidget track. It's bound to get a few asses shakin'. Get it while it's hot!
