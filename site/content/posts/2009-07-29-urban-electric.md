In case you've been living under a rock for the past month or so, you've probably heard of the massive music festival known as [The Urban Electric](/2009/07/29/the-urban-electric/) to be held on the 1st of August. For those of you that haven't heard about it let me give you a brief rundown of what to expect.

The party starts at 2pm and will be held at the Woods in Newtown. There will be four stages, each with it's own distinct flavour. Expect a mix of your favourite DJ's and bands including Richard the Third, Sibot, Data Takashi, Desmond and the Tutus and Zebra and Giraffe to name just a few!

All in all you can expect to see 26 different acts, plenty of food and drink to keep you going and a great atmosphere thanks to awesome sound and lighting. And best of all it's only 90 rond for the experience! See y'all there ya'hear!
