Our favourite anonomyous circuit benders X & Y of Machette Jacobite are almost done with their album. Or maybe they already are and don't have a name yet. Or maybe they already have a name but aren't telling. No matter. Judging from this glitchy pearl the album is going to get a few heads nodding to some insane distorted and destroyed sounds. Rumour has it a live show is also in the works, so who knows maybe the secret will be out soon...
