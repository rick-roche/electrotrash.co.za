Yesterday there was a brief nod towards the new Lapse remix of Felix Da Housecats' new track 'We all wanna be Prince'. Today I uploaded the track to our own server for easy access! Lapse takes Felix Da Housecats' new single off his soon to be released album and makes it a smooth, synthy gem that is both catchy and fun to listen to. Like all his remixes this one is as perfect for the dancefloor as it is for your iPod. What can I say, the track is a sexy motherfucker...
