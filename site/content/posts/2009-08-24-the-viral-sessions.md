In our continued attempt to bring some fun and awesomeness to the 012 (Pretoria) the VIRAL Sessions have been launched. Opening things up will be [Red Eye Jedi](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=36560449450), a stonerjam band featuring guitars and djembe's. This will be followed by Jozi's own ridiculously awesome Destrukto and the [Cutout Collective](http://www.facebook.com/cutoutcollective), an electronic/alternative band that combines synths and drum machines with live drums and live visuals. To wrap things up Rick Disco & yours truly (dirtyoldman) will be bringing the bangin' electro as the dirtyoldDisco!

Damage is only 25 rond and if you arrive before 21h30 you'll get a free shot. There is also talk of a special (i.e. cheap) cocktail for the night. Safe parking will be available at Brooklyn Mall. So dust off those dancin' shoes, put on those party pants and get ready for a fun night out! With your support these nights will become a regular feature in the Pretoria party scene and we will strive to bring you a variety of the countries best DJs! See ya'll there :D
