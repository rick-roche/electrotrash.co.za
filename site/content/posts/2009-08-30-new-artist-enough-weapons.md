[![Enough Weapons](/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/enough-weapons1.jpg "Enough Weapons")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/enough-weapons1.jpg)

So after a whole bunch of technical difficulties the site is back to running as normal. We have a new events section that is slightly different, but way cooler so give it a look! If you have problems with anything please let us know so we can fix it ASAP!

On a lighter note, a new artist is up on the site... Enough Weapons are a Cape Town based, electronic dance production duo putting out glitchy chopped up funky breaks and tech with deep grinding bass lines!

Read more about them [here](/artists/enough-weapons/ "Enough Weapons"). We have a couple of their tracks up for download, give them a listen and let us know what you think!
