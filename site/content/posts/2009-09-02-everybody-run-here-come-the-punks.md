Haezer's back with a brand new track and if you don't like it you must be whack. Ok, so maybe rhyming isn't a hidden talent of mine, but whatever...

'Here Come the Punks' is the newest track from Cape Towns' Haezer. In true Haezer style, this track is a brutal electro banger, featuring angry synths and even angrier girl vocals. This one is bound to get a few kids fall to the dancefloor with epileptic fits complete with foamy mouth and twitching limbs! Download at your own peril...
