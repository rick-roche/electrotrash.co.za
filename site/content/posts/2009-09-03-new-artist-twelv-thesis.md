We got a new artist up for you guys and it's none other than the super bass heavy duo of Twelv & Thesis! These Jozi boys really love their bass and breaks. Check out their artist page [here](/artists/twelv-thesis/).

They also kindly sent us a copy of a super bouncy track called 'Games' which you can download below. It features lyrics that show their love for video games and a groovy bassline over some mid-tempo breaks. As a bonus it's in 320kbps nogal! Enjoy!
