Amsterdam's [Don Diablo](http://www.myspace.com/dondiablo "Don Diablo on Myspace") has nearly finished his debut album and some killer tunes will not make the final cut! ''Get On The Floor' is one of those tracks... Don: "_Some great songs just didn't fit with the rest of the sound, but that doesn't mean it has to end up in my private collection!_" Don recorded this song with the same guys that featured on his club smash 'Blow' from a while back and it's really a feel good summer party tune, if we may say so!

Grab the track below! Sexy summer Sunday music!
