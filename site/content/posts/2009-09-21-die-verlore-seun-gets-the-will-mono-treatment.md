Jozi based Will Mono got his hands on 'Die Verlore Seun' from the original Limpop group Gazelle and gave it an electro treatment. The track features a stabby, filtered & distorted synth that drives the track. Although the vocals haven't been played with too much, the ooh's and aah's of the original are more prominent and give the track that 'sexy electro' feel that the kids dig so much! Grab it below.

Will also did a remix with Mike from [MPI Project](http://www.myspace.com/mpiproject) which they describe as a "shebeen interpretation". It's got a more of a 'housey' feel to it and a bit of township groove.
