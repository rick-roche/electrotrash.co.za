So Jozi based Alternative/Electro band Cutout Collective gave their track 'Bloodlines' to electronic alchemist [Jacob Israel](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jacob-Israel/8633358962?ref=ts). True to form he took the track, mangled it up and spat out something amazing, both glitchy and melodic. Head over to their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/cutoutcollective?ref=ts) page to hear a couple other Cutout Collective tracks.

Jacob Israel is set to release his new album soon & we will be bringing you a review as soon as it hits! In the mean time check out these two tracks from his first two albums, both of which you can download for free over at [chrisus.tv](http://www.chrisus.tv)

This next track comes from his first album 'My Paper Nautilus'. It is a surreal-dream like track which transports you to another place (Narnia perhaps?) Get the album here.

Finally, from his second album 'Birthright' and also featured on the [Moxyland](http://www.moxyland.com/) soundtrack comes this gritty banger. It features dirty synths and great drum programming (as is the norm with Jacob Israel tracks). Grab the album [here](http://www.chrisus.tv/downloads/birthright.zip).
