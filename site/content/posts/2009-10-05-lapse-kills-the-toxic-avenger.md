After his recent visit to South Africa, The Toxic Avenger gave the separates to his new single 'Toxic is Dead' to Cape Town's \[Lapse, who promptly churned out a remix in true Lapse style, very sexy and "oh-so danceable". The remix is extended to just under seven minutes and builds up slowly until finally breaking, which I'm sure will get a few kids moving. The original is already very smooth, but Lapse manages to iron out the finest creases in order to make even more so! Grab it below in full 320kbps glory and listen to the original via Soundcloud.
