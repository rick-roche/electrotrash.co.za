It's always great to get a new artist on the site, especially when it's someone from a band you have always liked! Myrid Ambre is Stephen Timm from [The Buckfever Underground](http://www.myspace.com/thebuckfeverunderground "The Buckfever Underground"), and although really different (this time it's ambient electronica) it's still pretty awesome!

Grab a sample track below and read more about Myrid Ambre [here](/artists/myrid-ambre/ "Myrid Ambre")!

Stephen has told me that the first person to guess who is doing the main vocals on the track will get a **FREE** copy of his album. So anybody, everybody, anywhere in the world... leave a comment below with your guess (when you leave the comment you have to leave an email address - we will contact you on that!) and if you are the first person to guess correctly, a free CD is yours!

If you are in Cape Town on Wednesday 28 October, go on down to [Mabu Vinyl](http://www.mabuvinyl.co.za/ "Mabu Vinyl") (2 Rheede Street, Gardens, Cape Town) and watch Myrid Ambre perform live! It starts at 6PM and there will be free stuff!
