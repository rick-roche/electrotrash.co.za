[![Nobody Beats The Drum](/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/nobodybeatsthedrum.jpg "Nobody Beats The Drum")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/nobodybeatsthedrum.jpg)

I got an email from these guys and after listening to the tracks, I had to share it with you. Nobody Beats The Drum are a Dutch electro band that create a "fusion of breaks, electro, hip hop and every other form of music that whips a crowd up into a sweaty, writhing heap of body parts!" They also dress up as robots, so they have my stamp of approval!

Grab the track and a remix below, go and check out their [website](http://www.nobodybeatsthedrum.com/ "Noboy Beats The Drum") as well as their [myspace](http://www.myspace.com/nobodybeatsthedrum "Noboy Beats The Drum"). I have also added the music video to the track which will make you wanna hop on a plane to go and see them live!
