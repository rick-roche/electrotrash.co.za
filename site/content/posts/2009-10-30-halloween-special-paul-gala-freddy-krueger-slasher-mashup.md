[![Freddy Krueger](/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/freddy.jpg "Freddy Krueger")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/freddy.jpg)

My old friend [Paul Gala](http://www.myspace.com/paulgalamusic "Paul Gala") got in touch with me the other day and dropped this one off just in time for Halloween! Some of you may remember Paul as one of the members of South African electro band "[Black Rabbit](http://www.myspace.com/blackrabbitfollowthe "Black Rabbit on Myspace")". Black Rabbit are (sadly :( ) no more but Paul and Mia (the stunning vocalist from Black Rabbit) are now married and kicking it in the U.K.

Paul assures me that we will be hearing a lot more from him in the future, which is awesome as he is one very talented individual.

The track - as the name suggests - is all about [Freddy Krueger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Krueger "Freddy Krueger on Wikipedia"), features Mia on vocals and will make you wanna dance in your Halloween costume for the whole weekend! Oh yeah!
