I bet you're wondering why we're featuring an Italian group on a blog that is focused on South African electronic music. Ok so we have featured one or two Dutch acts in the past, but in general we tend to stick to the +27 since there are countless blogs out there dedicated to electronic music that get the songs mailed to them and thus post them long before we even know about their existence! We don't want to be one of those blogs that just reposts songs from other blogs and without the permission of the artists and/or labels. However this time round is a bit special. We got permission from [Dim Mak](http://www.dimmak.com) (thanks!) to put up this track, so let me tell you why.

Those of you that saw the [Bloody Beetroots](http://www.myspace.com/thebloodybeetroots) live a few months back know how awesome this duo is. Some of you may even have a copy of their album Romborama, released earlier this year. If you do in fact have a copy, then the voice featured on the 12th track called 'Theolonius (King Voodoo) may have sounded familiar. Turns out it is Xander Ferreira, better known as the face of Limpop act Gazelle. I thought I'd share this with you guys in the hope of showing you that you don't have to be Dave Matthews or Seether to break beyond our borders. A case in point being the Mr. Vega remix of Popskarr (He's from Brooklyn) or the Saint Pauli and Toxic Avenger remixes of the new Haezer single (more on that in the future...). I guess what I'm saying is just keep making the best music you can and try not to limit yourselves to Jozi or Cape Town or even just South Africa. Like the saying goes: "think locally, act globally". Not sure if that applies, but it sure sounds good!
