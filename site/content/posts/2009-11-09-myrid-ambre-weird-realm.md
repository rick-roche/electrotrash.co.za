First off, congrats to CF for winning a copy of the Myrid Ambre album by guessing the vocalist on the the track posted [here](/2009/10/20/new-artist-myrid-ambre/ "New Artist: Myrid Ambre")!

For the rest of us, here is another track from this minimal mastemind. Winding, well composed and beautiful is all I could come up with when trying to put this track into words.. You tell me. If you would like more from Myrid Ambre, you can buy his music from CDBaby [here](http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/myridambre "CDBaby: Myrid Ambre")!

The man behind Myrid Ambre is looking for someone to join him in a gig at the Waiting Room (Cape Town) in December / January on a Monday. If you are interested please get in touch with us and we will point you in the right direction! He is awesome, his music is awesome, you won't regret it.
