Our friend Stephen from [Muzikology](http://www.muzikology.com "Muzikology") sent us this early this morning...

[Don Diablo](http://www.myspace.com/dondiablo "Don Diablo")'s trademark guitarlicks, staccato basslines and distorted synths are all united in this funky little number called 'I need to know'. It will not be on his forthcoming album, but it does come in two versions, an original version and an extended mix for those who are not afraid to try shake things up in their neighbourhood disco.
