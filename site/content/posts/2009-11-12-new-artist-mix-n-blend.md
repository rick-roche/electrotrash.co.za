Well look what the internet dragged in! Cape Town's Mix n Blend are the newest addition to our artists section. Check it out [here](/artists/mix-n-blend/)! They make dubsteppy, hip hoppy, jazzy electro crunk soul.Â  Part of the African Dope stable, they have remixed and featured a number of premier South African acts. Look out for a review of their new album coming your way next week!

Check 'em playing @ OppiKoppi 2008:
