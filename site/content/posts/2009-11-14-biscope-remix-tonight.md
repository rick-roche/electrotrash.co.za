So the first remix of Tonight by Popskarr that I've come across is this awesome dubstep remake courtesy of the Rumney Bros. aka Biscope. The first 2:16 of the track lull you into a false sense of calmness that is completely destroyed as soon as that dirty bassline comes in (is that a Virus?). If this is the standard of remixes that we can expect I'm def. looking forward to hearing more! Grab it below.

Visit [Juno](http://www.junodownload.com/products/1482341-02.htm) to buy their track Down. Go on, do it! It's cheap and gives the boys some much need synth-money :D

After the jump check out two more Biscope tracks: Fire and their remix of of Ben E. King's Stand by Me!

True to Biscope form, Fire is a deep and dirty dubsteppin' track.

> Stereotypical Dubstep basslines and beats meet up with cut up rap samples, video game sounds and falsetto funk to make a mixture of dance-floor magic.

 [Biscope - Fire](http://soundcloud.com/biscope/biscope-fire) by [biscope](http://soundcloud.com/biscope)

A really cool remix of the classic with a Biscope twist. Niiiice!

> An epic remix of the all time feel-good classic that subtly builds from minimal organic textures into a stomping bass driven banger.
