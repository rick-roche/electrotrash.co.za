Capetonian [CoDeC](/artists/codec "CoDeC on electrotrash.co.za") has been making music for a while now and he decided to share some of his older stuff with us in what he is calling his "Retro Series EP". So here we are, four tracks from his past that are more in the vein of italo disco than the banging stuff he is involved with these days. It's very cool, takes me back with all the slick LoFi synths... good times!
