![Look mom, no hands](/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/mix_n_blend_300_x_300.jpg "Look mom, no hands")

Reading the press release that accompanied our copy of “Look mom, no hands” I couldn’t help but think, maybe I’ll just copy and paste the whole thing and upload two tracks from the album for your downloading pleasure. If the press release is anything to go by, the album should be amazing! It is, in fact, amazing and just copy/pasting the press release would cheapen the whole thing. Oh well, I guess it’s time for the review then.

The album is, as they say, genre busting (ok so I got that from the press release). Mix n Blend, err, mix and blend breaks, deep dubstep basslines and a hint of hip hop with some funk, a touch of soul and various synthesised sounds in order to bring you a sound that is very much their own and recognisable. Even though the album is a _mix_ of different sounds and influences it _blends_ together rather well, forming a coherent entity that is a joy to listen to (see what I did there?)!

Read the rest of the review, download Shall We Swing and stream their whole album after the jump.Being part of the African Dope stable, Mix n Blend have been lucky enough to collaborate with a number of great artists such as Fletcher, P.H. Fat, Bakaman & Farrell Adams to name but a few. It is in fact easier to name the tracks that _don’t_ feature one or two artists that the other way round! In case you were wondering they are: _Bass Niddies_ (a bass-heavy album opener that is a short teaser that serves to introduce you to the upcoming sonic goodness, The drum roll on the kick is reminiscent of the one in _Super evil_ but that is where the similarity ends)_, Morphed Code_ (Cape Town glitch at its best)_, Sik Wid It_ (another glitch track, this time featuring a sick deep-ass synth)  & _Full Ahead_ (an epic Drum ‘n Bass track that is sure to get you bouncing and loving trumpets)_._

P.H. Fat on _Spring Step_ drops some ill rhymes over a glitched out beat, while Pedro from 340ml lends his smooth vocals to the reggae infused _Sunday Afternoon Dub_. Farrell Adams, with his i-wanna-get-nasty voice, is featured on two tracks, the bouncy ragga track _Lazy Friday Sounds_ along with Rude Bobo Boss and on the funky _Out of Line_. _First Light_ featuring Rayelle can only be described as a powerful ambient track that features **massive** pads and chirpy synths that accent it beautifully. _Tantrum_ featuring SFR and EJ Von Lyrik from Godessa is somewhere between ragga, drum ‘n bass and hip hop, with a full on bass assault! EJ Von Lyrik is also featured on _Champion Sound_ alongside Bakaman. This one features a deep dubstep-like bassline over crazy breaks and mad flows. Crosby on _Out of Town_ brings the ragga voice to a deep bassline and broken beats, with some reggae guitars along for the ride. What starts out as an acoustic piece featuring Sian and Saucetone, _Drug in a Mug_ turns into a very relaxed glitchy track that is beautiful but still retains that Mix n Blend edge. My personal favourite has got to be the up tempo, big band swing track _Shall we Swing_ which features Fletcher and Sindy. Driven by snappy keys, swingin’ drums and sexy female vocals, the deep squelchy synthesised sounds are a nice touch that take a dancefloor filler and make it even harder to resist its pull.

Mix n Blend have really put something special together with this album. It is clean and professional in composition and great fun to listen to. They boys from Cape Town have resisted the urge to follow a single formula for their tracks which allows for some great variety in terms of genre, yet have maintained a sound that is definitely their own. Decide for yourself by streaming the album below and then buy a copy! I guarantee you won’t be disappointed. Also grab two tracks below in order to have something for your iPod until you get your copy.
