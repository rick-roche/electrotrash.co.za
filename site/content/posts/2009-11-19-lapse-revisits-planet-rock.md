![Planet Rock](/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/planet-rock1.jpg "Planet Rock")

Lapse is back and this time he has taken the classic track Planet Rock and chopped it into little bits, keeping only a few choice pieces and sticking it all back together again with a few of his own synths and drums thrown in for good measure. Lapse takes the electro (in the truest sense of the word) classic and reworks it into a banger. Boosh!
