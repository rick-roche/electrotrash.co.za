![Roundup!](/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/roundup-monsanto.jpg "Roundup!")

So it seems the Hype Machine has missed a number of downloads due to the fact that they weren't on the main page but in the article... So I thought I'd just have a quick post featuring the downloads that the Hype Machine missed. Bad Hype Machine! Bad. The first is a really fun track from Mix n Blend's new album Look mom, no hands

{{< audio

and the second is a Lapse revisit of the classic Planet Rock.

Both are extremely grab-worthy. Boosh!
