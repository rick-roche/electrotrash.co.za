The hard hitting, banger boasting [HAEZER](http://www.facebook.com/pages/HAEZER/24353086721 "HAEZER") is back on electrotrash with some super exciting news! He wants you to remix his track "Crack In The Wall". The best remix, as judged by him, will be featured on his E.P. being launched soon as well as on a European tour next year!Â  So instead of prize money or something like, you will simply get MAD exposure!

**HAEZER is looking for a banging remix, something around 130 BPM. Thats it.**

The competition ends mid January 2010, exact date will be announced closer to the time is 15 January 2010 so get remixing!
