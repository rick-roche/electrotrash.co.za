zim dollar bill are Narch and Liver. You may recall Richard the Third writing a bit about them in his Red Bull post.Â  These two kids from Cape Town make fat, bassy electro that just screams dancefloor. Check out their artist profile [here](/artists/zim-dollar-bill/), which has links to their facebook & myspace pages where you can stream a few of their other tracks. Grab the track _bleh!_ below, it's nice 'n dirty.
