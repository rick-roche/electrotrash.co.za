Lapse and IAmWaves, better known as Popskarr are back again with their new single S.P.I.L.L.S. and it's yours for the taking, free and legal! In their own words:

> It's a track tinged with 90's Rave/Disco/Kwaito (RSA's native Dance music) and Electro!

and they ain't kidding. Stabby keys really bring that rave feel home, while the vocals are drawn out and dark. Loving it!
