Stephen Timm aka [Myrid Ambre](/artists/myrid-ambre/ "Myrid Ambre") kindly sent us another track off of his debut album to share with all of you! This one is slightly darker than the rest, a bit more sinister as he says. Grab it below!

As a Christmas special, Stephen will be offering a buy one get one free promotion on his album... contact him on _stephentimm@yahoo.com_ for more details on how to get that! Otherwise why not pop over to CDBaby.com at [http://cdbaby.com/cd/myridambre](http://cdbaby.com/cd/myridambre) to buy a copy there or download individual tracks for a small price, or try the local Rhythm Online Music store at [http://rhythmmusicstore.com/music/5514/Myrid-Ambre/Myrid-Ambre](http://rhythmmusicstore.com/music/5514/Myrid-Ambre/Myrid-Ambre).
