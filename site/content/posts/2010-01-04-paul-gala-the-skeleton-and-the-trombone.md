Paul Gala (_previously part of South African electro band Black Rabbit_) sent us his latest track... a winding club tune filled with bass and beats sure to get you shaking it.

\[download#206#nohits\]

Check out his [Soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/paulgala "Paul Gala on Soundcloud") for more tracks from him.

Paul also recently did a remix of Tomcraft - Biscuit that you can buy [here](http://www.djdownload.com/mp3-detail/Tomcraft/Biscuit/Exx+Germany/961431 "Tomcraft - Biscuit Remix")!

With an EP due to be out in the next five weeks, I'm sure we will have a lot to say about Paul this year... Stay tuned!

^5!
