CoDeC sent me this electro Rock and Roller so I thought I would share it with y'all. It's a pretty awesome tune, well put together synths and a grinding tune. Love that!

I am also busy with crafting a new look for electrotrash so stay tuned in the next month for a new look and hopefully an easier to use site! If you have any suggestions please drop us a line in the [Contact](/contact "Contact electrotrash.co.za") box!

^5!
