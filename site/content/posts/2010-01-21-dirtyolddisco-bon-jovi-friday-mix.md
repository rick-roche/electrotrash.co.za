Here is the first Bon Jovi Friday Mix of 2010... The mixes will be posted monthly (for now) on a Thursday at midday for all of you that are having a Bon Jovi Friday to enjoy... Watch the video to see what we mean!

This first mix was done by the [dirtyoldDisco](http://dirtyolddisco.blogspot.com/ "dirtyoldDisco") (dirtyoldman and myself) and is a pretty nicely balanced banging (just over an) hour of music with a smooth build-up! Listen to it and let us know what you think!

\[download#213#nohits\] - _89MB, just over an hour!_

If you would like to submit a mix for our **Bon Jovi Friday** slot, get in touch via the [Contact box](/contact "Contact Us!")!

^5!
