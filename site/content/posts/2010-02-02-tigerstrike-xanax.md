Jonathan from [Tigerstrike](/artists/tigerstrike/ "Tigerstrike on electrotrash") sent me a new track of theirs! It's been too long since these incredibly talented electro-rockers were up on the front page of electrotrash!

Grab the track below... it is has a haunting, synthpop'ish melody that I couldn't stop whistling and when combined with their indie vocals it's a pretty rad sound!

I have been promised some killer remixes in the not too distant future so stay tuned!

^5!
