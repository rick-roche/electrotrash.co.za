HAEZER had this to say about the competition as well as the winning entry:

> "After listening to all the remixes over and over and also playing to peers and management I've finally come to an answer.
>
> Although I love all the remixes in the Top 5 I decided on the Chains remix for it's originality and creativity.
>
> I would like to thank everyone that took part in the comp and hope you get all the blog love and exposure you deserve for the remixes... and even though I chose Chains I'll definitely drop the other remixes in my sets as well.
>
> Props to everyone that was involved in this comp, especially electrotrash for all the support and good luck to all the producers for 2010... keep up the good work and banging tracks.
>
> peace e"
