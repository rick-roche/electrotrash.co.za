Fulka is Ola Kobak, who with the help from a few friends creates soft, delicate, melodic, electronic folk music. The first track out is Misunderstood which is a beautiful, lo-fi track which features banjo, a touch of vintage synth and that awesomely synthesised drum sounds courtesy of Roland and the 80's. Look out for more tracks right here, but in the mean time grab Misunderstood below and check the [artist page](/artists/fulka/) for more info!
