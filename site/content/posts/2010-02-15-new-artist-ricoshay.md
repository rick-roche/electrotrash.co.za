Gary from GaZo has started a new project with Mark Norrie from Durban rock band Driverlane. Together the two produce electro/rock with elements of electronica, house, ska and reggae. Already busy with their debut album, the two have decided to give us a taste of things to come with the track Luna. Luna is a takes it's cue from electro-pop tracks and is cute and fun without being cheesy. Get it below and check out their [artist page](/artists/ricoshay) for a full bio.
