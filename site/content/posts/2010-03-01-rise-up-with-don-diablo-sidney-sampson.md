Our regular readers may have noticed that things have been slow of late. This is not due to a lack of content, we've actually got a bit of a backlog going on here at ET HQ, but the real world is keeping us much busier than foreseen. No matter, after some reshuffling and what not, we should be back to business as usual...

Anyway, back to the music. Our dutch buddy Don Diablo is releasing his latest project, Monster EP, on May 8th via Beatport and iTunes. Together with Sidney Sampson he has produced 2 "monster tracks". Promo snippet:

> Holland's globetrotting Hooligan producer, **DON DIABLO**, teams up with **SIDNEY SAMSON** of _'Riverside'_ fame to deliver the already much sought after **'MONSTER EP'**, which consists of two massive weapons of dancefloor destruction, **'Monster'** and **'Rise Up'**. The 'MONSTER EP' has already found earlybird supporters in **Pete Tong**, **Rob Birch** (Stereo MC's), **Zombie Nation**, **Infadels**, **Jack Beats**, **Tocadisco**, **Tom Stephan**, **The Crystal Method**, **Utah Saints**, **Aston Harvey** (Freestylers), **MJ Cole,** **NT89**, **Kraak & Smaak**, **Lee Mortimer**, **Bad Boy Bill**, **MistaJam (BBC 1Xtra)**, **Steedlord**, **Jason Nevins**, **Larry Tee**, **Beni** (Kitsune), and many many more.
