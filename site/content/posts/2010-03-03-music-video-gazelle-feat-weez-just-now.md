If you were in Pretoria this Saturday passed and you didn't go to Tings 'n Times you missed an epic show. Gazelle really put on an awesome live show that draw in the crowd and gets them dancing. The video for Just Now was shot on location in Switzerland at Art Basel during their recent European tour.Â  With Gazelle better known for their afro-disco-electro-pop aka LIMPOP and their on stage style and glam, it's nice to see they're not above a bit of social commentary. In case you're wondering, the bank notes being thrown around were actually flyers for his Basel show...
