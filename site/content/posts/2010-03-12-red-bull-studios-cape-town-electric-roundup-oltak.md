One of the great things about the Red Bull Studio is that is has an open door policy. Everyday all sorts of creative types, mostly musical, wander in and out. Sometimes we know who they are and other times we're pleasantly introduced to someone new to the scene.

I know nothing about Oltak except that his real name is Katleho Makhale and he makes sick spacey hip-hop in the vein of Flying Lotus, Sa-Ra, Dizz 1 and the like. He dropped off a gang of beats to listen to and I kindly asked if I could upload the track "Red Moon" for all to hear because it's just so fresh. Take a listen or a download below and if you like, head over to his Myspace page by [clicking here.](http://www.myspace.com/oltak)

Then keeping with the spacey 8-bit hip-hop vibes here are three shows from Red Bull Music Academy Radio. Both Hudson Mohawke and Samiyam are Red Bull Music Academy alumni, while Flying Lotus needs little introduction being one of the all time masters of mad beatsmanship. Take a listen on the RBMA Radio player below:
