[Closer](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=419391303384 "Closer") is a fresh collaboration between Tokyo Sky, Deconstruction, Kat Trim & Trouble Magazine.

Expect an alternative music experience every Thursday night, filled with the music we love, beautiful visuals and an electrifying venue.

We are playing with traditional formulas and mixing it up. The chemistry is volatile, the result is alchemy.

It’s a new residence for alternative music and culture in a non- traditional setting.

Each week will feature Deconstruction and guest DJ’s with a blend of visuals, art and fashion, which is all incorporated through a dance floor, an open lounge area and exhibition spaces.

Come through early, share a Bento box and enjoy a drink at the restaurant lounge and get in free.

Starts 25th March, floor opens at 8.30 pm. Details [here](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=407100117773&ref=mf "Closer")!
