If you missed Haezer while he was up in Gauteng, shame on you! You missed some epic shows! One of the coolest tracks he's been dropping is his remix of We're not French by Swedish electro-duo F.O.O.L ([Fuck](http://www.facebook.com/pages/FOOL-Music/163116568115) [Our](http://www.myspace.com/fuckourordinarylives) [Ordinary](http://soundcloud.com/fuckourordinarylives) Lives). The [original](http://soundcloud.com/fuckourordinarylives/f-o-o-l-were-not-french-original-mix) is full of distorted synths and arps and actually has quite an awesome groove to it.

Haezer turns it up to 11 and makes it filthy as fuck. Apart from shredding up the synths and adding some epic build ups and breaks, the remix also features some classic Haezer vocal samples. Grab it below!
