[Enough Weapons](/artists/enough-weapons/ "Enough Weapons") are a production and DJing duo comprised of Dave Love and Hiyarant who make knock-your-block-off nu-skool breakbeat.

When not busting the beats these two are very active members of Cape Town’s ever lucrative and popular psytrance scene, making music that really does make more sense when combined with hallucinogens and throwing those massive outdoor parties that are all about the stomp. Psytrance is in itself a helluva technical genre, all about never-heard-before layers of sound, so when we locked the guys in the studio with the Moog and Virus synthesizers we knew they would deliver the goods.

Dave Love incidentally runs the independent label, On A Break, featuring a host of artists such as Audiophile 021, Zim Dollar Bill and Biscope. Check out their website here where you can grab links to buy tunes on Beatport and the like.

Ok enough talk, Enough Weapons – Take the Bull by the Horns, probably the biggest floor tune on this blog ever, it will make you need to hit the club tonight! And it even has a cheeky product placement sample in it…

Then onto Red Bull Music Academy Radio, this show is a selection of fine cuts from the kings of breakbeat, the Stanton Warriors.
