Introducing MTKIDU's latest album entitled "Skeleton Key" with a concept that will release each track off of the album, every two weeks from now! We gave you a taste a few weeks ago with the unmastered leak of "AWB vs ANC" (see the post [here](/2010/04/21/new-mtkidu-track-leaked/ "AWB vs ANC leak")!) but now it is yours in its album version glory.

To be able to download each track, a website and a corresponding "skeleton key" will be released giving you access. So for AWB vs ANC head on over to the link below!
