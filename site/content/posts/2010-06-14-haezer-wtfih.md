[HAEZER](http://www.facebook.com/pages/HAEZER/24353086721 "HAEZER") has had his first single released on Beatport! Who The Fuck Is HAEZER is a banger that we shared with you a while ago (refresh your memory [here](/2009/01/14/destroy-the-dancefloor/ "WTFIH")!), and now you can buy it and a whole bunch of awesome remixes on Beatport!

Go and have a look over [here](https://www.beatport.com/en-US/html/content/release/detail/251687/WTFIH "HAEZER - WTFIH (BeatPort)"), and support HAEZER!

^5!
