[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BBE156ACDuDG_Cover-1500pxls.jpg "MSHINI WAM")](/2010/07/28/red-bull-music-studio-spoek-mathambo-dont-be-scared/bbe156acdudg_cover-1500pxls/)Part of a new breed of African artists, 24 year old **Spoek Mathambo** (Rapper/DJ and Graphic Designer/Illustrator) is hitting the world hard with his take on Afro-futurism. Spoek sees himself as a part of a new wave of energy in Africa, which is intent on nurturing a sense of progressiveness while maintaining a pride in culture. As front-man for electrorap outfits **SWEAT.X** and **PLAYDOE**, Spoek Mathambo has become a increasingly prominent figure in the international music scene over the last couple of years.

Most recently, Spoek Mathambo has finished recording his solo album, **Mshini Wam** for BBE, and has built a live band (which includes two dancers) in order to tour the project. The release of this project is particularly exciting as a sign to the world of what Africa has in store in terms of progressive electronic music.

The bulk of the songs on the album were recorded and produced at the Red Bull Studio in Cape Town and although it will only be available as of September through the prolific label BBE, the single for album, **Mshini Wam b/w Gwababa (Don’t Be Scared)”,** is available for purchase on various online channels. Featuring **remixes by** **Schlachthofbronx, DJ Mpula (Batida), Subtitle, Krazy Fiesta, DJ Rashad, Marvy Da Pimp, BBQ, Canblaster and Bara Bröst,** it’s a heavy duty release which covers every concievable corner of the electronic music spectrum.

To get an idea of the heavier sounds of album take a listen and download to the track **Germs (H.V.I.P.).** Otherwise check out the digital release for the single here: [**Spoek Mathambo -**](http://goog_301031547/) **[Mshini Wam b/w Gwababa (Don’t Be Scared).](http://bbemusic.com/data.pl?release=BBE156SDG-1)**
