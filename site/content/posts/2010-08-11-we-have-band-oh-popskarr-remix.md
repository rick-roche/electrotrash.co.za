Them boys from Popskarr dropped off this awesome remix of We Have Band's Oh! The original has that typical indie-dance-rock sound, which Popskarr replace with deep synths and keys. Overall the treatment is effictive. The remix sounds like what the original should've sounded like. Plus it has a dj friendly intro and outro. Bonus! I see this remix getting dem kids dancin'... Grab it below and check the video of the original after the jump, just so you can hear what I mean!
