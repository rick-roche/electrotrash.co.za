Johnny Neon just dropped off a remix of his track 'Hearts' by Who Killed JR that's hot off the presses and ready for _FRIDAY THE 13TH!!!_

The remix has that electro banger feel / disco feel you get from slap bass and dirty synths. It really has a party vibe to it and I wouldn't be surprised if you hear it on a dancefloor near you soon.
