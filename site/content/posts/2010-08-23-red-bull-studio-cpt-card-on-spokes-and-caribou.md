As a part of the avant-garde future-looking Cape Town Jazz scene, performing in bands such as Closet Snare and Babu, Shane Cooper is that rare and brilliant kind of artist who can match his hip-hop swagger and nerdy electronica with true musicianship.

His solo project, Card On Spokes, is in his own words an electronica / hip hop / afrikaanstrumental project performed, much like Mr. Sakitumi, live with samplers, synths and double bass.

The Red Bull Studio happily invited the talented musician to perform and record a live set. The results are true to Cape Townâ€™s long history of cutting-edge glitch-electro-hip-hop with a strong local flavour. Grab a listen and download below:

In the spirit of the best new electronica, have a listen to the Red Bull Music Academy Radio Fireside Chat with Caribou, otherwise known as Manitoba, one of the most prolific artists pushing modern electronic music today:
