[Sparrow](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sparrow/117364778307129 "Sparrow on Facebook") are a new and exciting electro duo out of Cape Town, South Africa. Comprised of Gareth H. Graham and Gavin Gilowey, they bring an interesting blend of electro house, pounding drum beats and orchestral swells to the Cape Town scene. You can find them in our Artists page here!

They are currently working on pulling together tracks for their debut EP, as well as working on their Podcast series of DJ Mixes, “Get Shitfaced & Dance” (Which we will be linking you to soon!).

Grab two grinding tracks below and practice in your room.
