So Johnny Kotze ([Johnny Neon](/artists/johnny-neon/ "Johnny Neon")) & Yannick Ilunga ([Popskarr](http://www.facebook.com/popskarr "Popskarr!")) have joined forces to create a "Dark Pop Dreamwave" group called "PRADA".The music is very electro pop with Johnny's distinctive vocals being complimented by Yannick. It makes me wanna drink buy-one-get-one-free cocktails and dance the night away.

We're giving you a free track below... listen to it, love it and keep your ears peeled for more!
