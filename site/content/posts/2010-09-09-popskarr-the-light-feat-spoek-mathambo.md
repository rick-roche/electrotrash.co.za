[![Kids Will Cuss!](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/popskarr-yannick.jpg "Popskarr - Yannick")](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/popskarr-yannick.jpg) _Yannick rocking a [Kids Will Cuss](http://kidswillcuss.blogspot.com/ "Kids Will cuss") T-Shirt!_

These guys have been very busy lately which is great! I am told they destroyed Durban on the weekend when they roadtripped over there to play at the Zulu Jazz Lounge. They will be ripping it up on the [Music Box Stage at Earthdance, Cape Town](http://www.earthdancecapetown.co.za/lineup/music-box-stage/ "Earthdance 2010") over the weekend of the 17, 18, 19 September... I'm jealous! After that you can head up the West coast to [Rocking The Daisies](http://rockingthedaisies.com "Rocking The Daisies") to catch them on the weekend of the 8, 9, 10 Octoboer, it's going to be magical!

So a long story short, these guys are making waves and are incredibly good at it so don't miss out on catching them live every chance you get! Just listen to this new track of theirs featuring [Spoek Mathambo](http://www.myspace.com/spoek "Spoek") ([Sweat.X](http://www.myspace.com/sweatx "Sweat.X")) to see what I mean!
