Placid Larry (aka Daniel Ray van Zyl) started his career in 1999 and has been making waves since then! Read all about him in our Artists section [here](/artists/placid-larry/ "Placid Larry")!

Under the alias "Placid Larry", Daniel encompasses ambient, chill out, trip-hop and electronica genres. He was kind enough to send through two of his tracks for you to listen to. They are beautiful, perfectly composed downtempo masterpieces! Give them a listen below and let us know what you think. _Note: They will only be available for download for three weeks_.
