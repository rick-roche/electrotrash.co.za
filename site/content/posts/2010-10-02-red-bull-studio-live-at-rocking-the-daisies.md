The Red Bull Studio Live stage at Rocking the Daisies 2009 swept the festival onto its feet with a electrocuting line-up of DJs and live acts on the razors edge of modern music perfectly complemented by a soundsystem, lighting and VJ rig that raised the bar for electronic music stages country wide. Following in its stride, the Studio Live Stage at Oppikoppi this year delivered and equally powerful roster of the some of the countries most gene-genre-splitting artists and acts.

With both last year’s RTD and Oppikoppi under it’s belt, this year’s Red Bull Studio Live Stage at Rocking the Daisies 2010 is set to raise the bar once more by showcasing some of South Africa’s most progressive and exciting electronic music acts and DJs including Haezer, Mix n Blend, Culoe De Song, Sibot, Niskerone, Popskarr, 7 ft. Soundsystem and many more.

Across all genres, from the deep waters of South African house and dubstep to the gigawatt power of peak hour electro and techno to the jaw-dropping left-of-centre sonics of live electronica, the stage will once again set the lawns of the Cloof Wine Estate on fire from Friday till Sunday, from start to finish.

Check out this video to get a taste of the sights and sounds you can expect from a Red Bull Studio Live stage.
