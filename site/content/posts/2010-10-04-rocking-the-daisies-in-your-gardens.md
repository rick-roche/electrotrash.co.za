This weekend see's one of the raddest festivals hitting both the Western Cape and Gauteng at the same time! [Rocking The Daisies](http://rockingthedaisies.com "Rocking The Daisies") is down at the Cloof Wine Estate in Darling, 8,9 and 10 October and [Rocking The Gardens](http://rockingthegardens.com/ "Rocking The Gardens") is at Emmarentia Dam in Johannesburg.

The international highlight at both festivals this year will be the appearance of [New Young Pony Club](http://newyoungponyclub.com/ "New Young Pony Club")... They will be performing on Friday night at Cloof on the main stage at 22:00 and then on Saturday night at Emmarentia on the main stage at 21:00!

The Cape festival has an insane line-up, as can be seen [here](http://rockingthedaisies.com/lineup/ "Line-Up: RTD")! Red Bull Studio Live will be hosting loads of electrotrash favourites down there as well... see what we had to say about the [here](/2010/10/02/red-bull-studio-live-at-rocking-the-daisies/ "Red Bull Studio Live at Rocking The Daisies")!

The festival up in Gauteng is a bit smaller but still managed to pull together a rad line-up... check that out over [here](http://rockingthegardens.com/2010/03/31/line-up-2010/ "Line-Up: RTG")!

See you there!

^5!
