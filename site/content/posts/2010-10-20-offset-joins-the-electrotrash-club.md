Our latest artist to be featured on the site is Offset, AKA Kevin Louw. He hails from Durban and brings some phat beats to the table. Read more about him over [here](/artists/offset/ "Offset")!

Grab these three tracks below to get a taste of what he is about and then why not head on down to his [Soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/kevin-offset "Offset on Soundcloud") to sample his back catalogue?

His remix of "Pressure" by The Fuzz is a slow winder that builds up really nicely with some mature production. The "Soulkiller" remix is some nice, back to basics, drum & bass... not too hard, with a good dose of vocals. "Scratch That Lick" finishes off the trio of tasters with a more downtempo beat showing just how versatile Offset can be. The remixes were done in the last year or two with "Scratch That Lick" coming from older works that Offset has done.
