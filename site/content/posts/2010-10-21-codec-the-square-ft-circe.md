We haven't heard from [CoDeC](/artists/codec/ "CoDeC") for a while, so it was great to see this track, "The Square", sitting in my inbox. The track features a lovely lady by the name of Circe on vocals. Circe has been doing vocals on a number of HAEZER tracks over the last while, but it's rad to hear her taking more of a centre stage in a track. Check her out [here](http://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/pages/Circe/349363455435 "Circe on Facebook!")!

CoDeC brings out a lot of beautiful bass in this one as well as some really well composed progressions. The tune is a little harder than the older CoDeC stuff but shows a direction that I really like. He does tell me that he is busy producing an 11 track album for his band called St. Savior ([Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/?sk=messages#!/pages/St-Saviour/140219762660262 "St. Savior")). St. Savior is "Sunday afternoon music" and it's pretty nice... I will let you know more when I do on them, but for now check out the bands Facebook page.
