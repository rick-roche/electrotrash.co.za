Fulka, [this one](/artists/Fulka/) not [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFa0rM211HQ&feature=related), has been a regular feature here, since the release of [_Misunderstood_](/2010/02/09/id-fulka/). We loved the full length album [_The Mystery of the Seven Stars_](/2010/10/06/review-fulka-the-mystery-of-the-seven-stars/). It is with great excitement that we heard about the release of the release of a brand new music videoÂ  for the track _Dancing In our Darkest Days_ and by Louis Minnaar no less. That's one busy guy.

Filters create a retro/vintage feel that lends itself well to the track. The video captures the spirit of the track beautifully. Opening to a scene of over the top breakfast preparation by Mrs. Kobak it moves to a scene of her band, waking in up and deciding to skip breakfast in favour of an old fashioned sing-a-long... The song really does feel like waking up on a warm summers day without a care in the world.
