Regular readers should recognise the name Who Killed JR as the guy who did that rad remix of Johnny Neon. In fact he is far more than that. His talent at remixing has already gotten international artists and labels begging him for a remix. Personally, I am not surprised. Take this remix he did of the new Anoraak track _Crazy Eyes_. Sexy slap bass and stabby synths blend together to make a track so sweet, Kitsune even noticed... Expect some great new tracks in the near future! There will be a full artist page coming up soon, but in the mean time, grab the remix below and check him out on [FB](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Who-Killed-JR/140418519308677) and [SC](http://soundcloud.com/who-killed-jr).
