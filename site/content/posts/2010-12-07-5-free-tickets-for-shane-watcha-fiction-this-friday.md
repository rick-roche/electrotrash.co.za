Here a little info grabbed from his [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/shanewatcha) page:

> From spinning Acid House to a small club in South Africa many years ago, to presently playing alongside house music’s greatest legends at London’s coolest clubs. A regular in Europe from Paris to Moscow, Shane's lust for house music has seen him slug his record bags around Europe, touring the world over while continuing to hold down his London residency for both Circo Loco & Zombie Soundsystem. With a steady flow of record releases via his own record label...Zombie Soundsystem
>
> Among the current trend of DJ’s/Producers coming out of London, Shane is a rare Breed. He has crafted a sound that is uniquely him and distinguishes him from the rest of the pack. It’s all delivered in a supremely tight mix that flows with emotion and slamming underground productions. Shane’s sets in London have earned him a fan base that some top jocks can only dream about.
>
> Since those humble beginnings in his home town of Durban, Shane has gone on to be a regular at London top clubs, playing Glastonbury to warehouse raves in East London. From playing DC10 opening party in Ibiza, & to the main stage @ TDK festival alongside Sasha, BookaShade ,Loco Dice & James Holden. The quality of Shane’s sets have seen him playing alongside legends like Frankie Knuckles, Todd Terry, Marshall Jefferson, Derrick Carter to present day heroes like Mathew Jonson, Mathew Dear, Guido Schneider, Ewan Pearson, Steve Bug, Claude Von Stroke, Marc Houle, Konrad Black, Ralph Lawson, James Holden & Mr C.
>
> Shane also hosts the popular Zombie Soundsystem that has evolved from an after-party filled with creatures of the dancing deep, to a Global brand hosting club nights at London’s coolest club & now a music label reflecting that sound. Regular tour nights take the Soundsystem around Europe, the Middle–East, and as far afield as South Africa; globally spreading their sound around the world.
>
> Rewind a bit. The story starts in 1992 when Shane decides to leave South Africa for London inspired by the wave of dance music emerging in the late 80’s and embrace the music that has he been listening to. He then starts up his own club night… Zombie Soundsystem, which enjoys a devoted following and acts as the ideal platform for him to carve a reputation that would lead him onto the international stage.His sense of wanderlust first saw him making forays to Moscow, then mainland Europe, the Far East (Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia) then Australia and New Zealand incl the USA.
>
> Being inspired by the tribal sounds of Danny Tenaglia and intensity of Laurent Garnier and Carl Cox sets, Shane is always focused on the party & delivering cutting edge sets be it deep house or techno.
