Long time electrotrash.co.za supporter [CoDeC](/artists/codec/ "CoDeC") dropped this one off to kick off your holidays! He says it's been lying around on his computer for quite some... I can't see why he didn't let us onto this gem till now but I'm glad he did!

The track is "very much influenced by the sounds of Jean Michele Jarre, and the _Yamaha CS_\-_80_ a polyphonic analog _synthesizer_"... Enjoy!
