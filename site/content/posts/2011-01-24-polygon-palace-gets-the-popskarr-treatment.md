So I woke up around lunchtime to find this gem, fresh from being mastered, in my inbox. It comes of the second EP from Australian based Electro Duo [Polygon Palace](http://www.facebook.com/polygonpalace) entitled _We Have A Visual_, which apart from the this one features remixes by Human Life, Bubblegum Sci Fi and Pulsar.

The original is one of those electro/indie feel good tracks complete with stabby guitar riffs with support by upbeat drums and synth-cheese dripping from all sides. For their remix, Popskarr strip the track down to bare bones and then proceed to subtly layer these in order to create a remix that sounds like Popskarr while retaining the essence of the original. Popskarr once again does not disappoint, but the entire EP is worth a listen. You can buy a copy [here](http://polygonpalace.bandcamp.com/album/we-have-visual-single-pack).
