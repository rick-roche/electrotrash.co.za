Cape Town based DJ and Producer, Battle Beyond the Stars, has just completed his first EP entitled _Memory_. The track _Cold,_ which I mentioned [previously](/2011/01/26/free-tickets-for-discotheque-w-bteam-kennedy-battle-beyond-the-stars-anthea-more/), is taken from this EP, as are the two songs below. His sound is both nostalgic and fresh. To find out a bit more about this talent producer of electronic nostalgia, check out his [Artist page](../../artists/battle-beyond-the-stars/) and remember to hit [The Assembly](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=124060950996819) tonight to catch his set.

_Memory Metal_ is like taking a drive down memory lane with a hangover from the night before. Gentle and subtle, the intro is led by a palm-muted guitar chord progression and a simple lead guitar melody. Add to this a pretty straight forward drum pattern and the severly distorted bass synth that follows, is an unexpected, but not unwelcome surprise. The synth really transforms the track from a gentle, summer melody into a song with more substance and emotion.

The second track features what can only be described as synthesised steel drums, distorted and filtered beyond recognition, producing a playful melody over Rock & Roll drums and a squelching bass synth. Think of this as the soundtrack to Fear and Loathing in Jamaica. \[_Rum Diaries? -ed.\]_
