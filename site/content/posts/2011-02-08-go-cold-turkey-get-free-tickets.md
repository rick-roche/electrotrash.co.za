...Has it been 2 weeks already? This Sunday it is time for the fifth installment of the awesome Cold Turkey parties. If you have not been yet, shame on you! It is the perfect way to spend your Sunday. Think lazy beats and bring and braai vibes! If you have a hangover from the night before, no matter, the bar is open (and hair-of-the-dog is still the best hangover cure!). For more info check out the event [here.](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=190595307631677)

We are also giving away guestlist + 1 to one lucky reader. If you are in Cape Town and free this coming Sunday, then all you have to do is mail us at [freeshit@electrotrash.co.za](mailto:freeshit@electrotrash.co.za?Subject=Cold%20Turkey) and tell us what you will be cooking over the fires! Most delicious sounding meal gets the tickets .  [Sanstenvad Bridge (feat.
