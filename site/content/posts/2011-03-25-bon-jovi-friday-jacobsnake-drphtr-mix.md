A Bon Jovi Friday on a Friday!?! What gives? The short answer, technical problems. This laptop is ancient. Anyway, moving on to the mix!

[JakobSnake](http://twitter.com/jakobsnake), one half of bteam, sent us this mix which simply oozes class. Well slease at times, but mostly class... In just under 45 minutes he explores a palette of (minimal) techno and acid house through tracks which almost necessitate a quality listening setup. So get out your quality cans, crank up the tube headphone amp and enjoy the ride. I could go on an on about this mix, telling you that it is on repeat on my stereo and in my car, but I think this mix speak for itself. Grab below and tell us what you think in the comments. Enjoy the weekend!
