[![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/artworks-000006048798-82kmo5-original.jpg "Liver 1000!")](/2011/04/05/new-liver-track-luke-niewenhuizen/artworks-000006048798-82kmo5-original/)In celebration of his 1000th fan on the Book of Faces, Liver decided to release a free track, named after that person. Unfortunately he was not sure who was fan number 1000 and who was 1001 so he just combined the two names. It is also his first track since returning to Jozi.

_Luke Niewenhuizen_ is large, filthy dubstep. The break hits hard and drops to a dense bass that just keeps getting fatter. Made for the dancefloor, this track will wobble your insides and make you bounce in the best of ways!
