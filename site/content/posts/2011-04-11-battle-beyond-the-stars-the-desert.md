Battle Beyond The Stars will be dropping his new EP entitled Memorial in the very near future. _The Desert_ is taken from this release, which promises to be something very special indeed. Simple drum programming and a tiny arp set the backdrop, for a synth with that "french-touch". I always imagine sunsets and convertibles when listening to BBTS and this track is no different. In fact, I think I'm gonna hop into my E-Type, put this one on repeat and cruise along the coast.
