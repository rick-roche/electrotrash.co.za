Not all producers can remix, luckily this does not apply to Audiophile 021. He sent through a number of top notch remixes that show his versatility across genres and his talents at reinterpreting music.

His remix of _Gunman_ by 187 Lockdown takes the speed garage track down a few notches in terms of tempo and kicks it into a more gentle dubstep groove with future garage touches. The remix is the equivalent to giving a kid with ADHD a joint and aÂ  bassline synthesizer.

Adding more glitch to _Drive it like you stole it_, the first single off the debut album of Los Angeles based trio Glitch Mob, seems impossible but Audiophile pulls it off, without destroying the track in the process. Big drums and stutters set the tone here and it simply works.

The remix of _Morning After Dark_ sees Audiophile 021 adding filth and removing Timbaland (and that annoying Auto-Tune). Perfection! This is a remix in the truest sense of the word. It retains elements of the original, while at the same time has its own feel and originality.
