_My Dreams_ is the second free track Popskarr are giving away as a prelude to their EP dropping in July. In case you missed the first track, _The Rise_, you can grab it [here](/2011/03/14/popskarr-the-rise/).

The production matches the title, with Lapse laying down serene and dreamy electro-pop over which IAmWaves pours his haunting vocals. On _My Dreams_ it becomes clear that Popskarr have grown in studio, without losing what made them Popskarr in the first place. July cannot come soon enough!
