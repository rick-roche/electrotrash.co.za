_Doubtless_ is full of Liver swagga. The drums have a funky swing in their step and the bass is filthy. The lead synth is edgy thanks to some well placed bit-crushing and at times moves into _Voodoo People_ territory. Makes me wanna climb in my mech and stomp on some fools!

Cardiff based Astroid Boys! comissioned a remix of their track _Welcometo the Zoo._ It is grimey, filthy and and whatever else my online thesaures spits out for dirty. The production is tight on this one, with strings and organs filling out the backend and massive drums shattering my windows.
