> GRIET and HAEZER have joined forces to create a new Cape Town party by the name of GO!GO! These parties will be held four to six times a year with cross genre dance line-ups and always in an interesting place – never a club! Experience Cape Town like you have never seen it before! GRIET is a Cape Town and Pretoria based events and artists agency. Best known for their Joberg and Pretoria “DOGBOX” parties which have hosted the likes of Cyberpunkers (Italy), Saint Pauli (Germany), Le Castle Vania (USA) and Dj Antention (Russia). More recently, GRIET in collaboration with RAMFEST brought you the Electro Pyramid stage with Tom Deluxx (France) and HAEZER. On Tuesday, the 26th of April, Cape Town will see the launch of GO!GO! at the City Hall, which will present to you the HAEZER ‘It’s Not Our Fault’ EP Launch. The launch will feature HAEZER with special guests Francois van Coke and Inge Beckmann, and the line-up includes the likes of Toby2Shoes, BTEAM, Mr Sakitumi and Hyphen. The first 300 people through the door will be receiving a free ‘It’s Not Our Fault’ EP, sponsored by Puma and brought to you by GRIET and Mahtrasher Records (Germany). Doors Open at 21h00 Entrance Fee: R60
