A couple of weeks ago we invited Das Kapital into the Red Bull Studio to flex his musical muscle. His Offering is a Dubstep shuffle of the highest order. A great dose of Bass infused pushes and raw, organic piano lines that tie the over-all sound of "Flight of the Robin" into a perfect, potent bundle that you'll have to listen to numerous times over.

A Purist's dream, and dance floor pleaser alike, this tune is a winner of all sorts!  [Das Kapital - Flight of the Robin](http://soundcloud.com/red-bull-studio-ct/das-kapital-flight-of-the) by [Red Bull Studio CT](http://soundcloud.com/red-bull-studio-ct)
