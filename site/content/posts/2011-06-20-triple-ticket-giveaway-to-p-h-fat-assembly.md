It is going to be a massive party, at one of Cape Towns best venues. We have three sets of tickets (that's you plus one!) to give away. All you have to do to stand a chance of winning is to send an email to [freeshit@electrotrash.co.za](mailto:freeshit@electrotrash.co.za?Subject=whoisfat) with the name of the act headlining The Assembly this Saturday. One entry per person, entries close at 23:59 Thursday. Winners chosen at [random](http://www.random.org/) will be contacted via email, losers won't.

Their debut album _Dinosaur Blood_ is out on [Muti](http://www.mutimusic.com/) now (with a review on its way!)
