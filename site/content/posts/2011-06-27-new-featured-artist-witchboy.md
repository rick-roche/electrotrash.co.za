Witchboy is the dark side of Nikhil Singh, one-third of the Wild Eyes. Creating what he calls _Necro-electro_, his music finds itself in the largely unexplored (at least in South Africa) rooms of Witchhouse. Dissonance & distortion colour the sound spectrum. If Jacques Derrida made electronic music, it would sound like this. Check out the brand new [Witchboy artist page](/artists/witchboy/ ‎)!
