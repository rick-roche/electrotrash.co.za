Audiophile 021 is in a remix frenzy at the moment. Before having a chance to put up his last remix, I get a call asking me to include the latest one he just finished. I wish my day job was sitting in a studio all day with unlimited amounts of Red Bull, maybe I would also get some shit done.

First up is his remix of the _Rolling in the Deep_ by Adele. The bass, thanks to Native Instruments, is massive, hovering underneath those amazing vocals. Audiophile 021 keeps things simple on this remix/fix which make the track that much crisper and polished. In terms of execution I think its right up there with the Jaimie XX Shuffle!

Ruffest are a Cape Town based kwaito-house group and a name to keep an eye on. These guys are going to be big, soon. The remix is deep and dense, the bass low with a slight wobble. Only the typical kwaito synth-bell melody of the original remain, along with the occasional Haibo!
