Indidginus is the solo project of Cape Town based artist Michael Martin. He makes use of slide didgeridoo in

his unique and eminently danceable live performances. His unique blend of styles range from ambient and

downtempo soundscapes through to dubstep, dub and dancehall. Check out his artist page [here](/artists/indidginus/)!

_Hold Your Vision_ was recorded at the Red Bull Studio in Cape Town and is deep, thoughtful dubstep. Featuring the trademark didgeridoo sound of Indidginus, the track sounds Â different from any dubstep you probably have heard, which is refreshing!
