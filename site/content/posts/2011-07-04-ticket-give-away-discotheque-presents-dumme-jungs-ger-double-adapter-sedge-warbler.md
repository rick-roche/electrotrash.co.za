> _Germany's **Dumme Jungs** comes to South Africa, joined by Joburg and Cape Town representatives **Double-Adapter** and**Sedge** **Warbler**... and backed by **Audiophile 021**, **George Daniel**, the **Contraband** VJs and more!_
>
> _**Dumme Jungs** released their debut single "Epic" on renowned techno label OH MY GOD! IT’S TECHNO MUSIC last year, bringing them into the global spotlight. Not just to clubgoers en masse, but top DJs such as Larry T, Cyberpunkers, Stereoheroes, Modek, Aerotronic and Dirty Disco Youth who have all embraced their Epic sound. But Dumme Jungs are more than just masters of the studio - their live shows leave other DJ sets looking more like the chill-out zone. Extrovert to the extreme, every Dumme Jungs performance whips the audience into a frenzy, across Europe and now the globe._
>
> _Joburg's **Double-Adapter** make dancefloor's explode with their hi-energy deejay/visual sets, a fact known in wider and wider circles thanks to their recent _Adapt Or Die_ European Tour and its coverage on MK._
>
> _**Sedge Warbler**. The pairing of Cape Town luminaries **Dank** and **Disco**, they released their debut _Welcome To The Universe_ this year, and are steadily increasing their influence across the globe._
