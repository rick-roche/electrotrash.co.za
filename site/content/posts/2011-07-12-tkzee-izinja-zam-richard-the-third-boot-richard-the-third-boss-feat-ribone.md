Richard the Third just sent through his latest production, a bootleg remix of the kwaito track _Izinja Zam_, byÂ veterans of the genre, TKZee. Adding a great deal of wobble to the bass, this tune is large! Kwaito-Wobble is going to be the next big thing with this remix leading the way.

_Boss_ features the vocal talents of Ribone and will get a real release in the near future, in the mean time listen to this, uhm, boss tune and do the wobbly knees dance! This track is going to be huuuuuuge!
