[Little Light Blue](/artists/little-light-blue "Little Light Blue") is the latest project from Capetonian Jaco Loots ([Oceans & Cities](/artists/oceans-cities/ "Oceans & Cities")). He has already released a full length album entitled "What We All Use To Imagine", released on 28 June as a digital download. Jaco classifies Little Light Blue as electronic, rock pop, acoustic, experimental which kind of sounds like a bit of everything... in reality it is a mixture that takes you on an ambient journey from downtempo all the way to some dubby sounds too. It is well worth the listen... Grab it below:
