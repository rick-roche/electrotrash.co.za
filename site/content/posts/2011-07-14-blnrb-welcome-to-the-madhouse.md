The minute I heard about this I just had to share it with all of you... Imagine awesome German electronicians [Modeselektor](http://www.modeselektor.com/ "Modeselektor"), [Gebrüder Teichmann](http://www.myspace.com/teichmann "Gebruder Teichmann") and  [Jahcoozi](http://www.jahcoozi.com/ "Jahcoozi") in Africa... Imagine them doing what they do with a host of African musicians... Imagine the awesomeness that would blossom out of something like that.

Imagine [BLNRB](http://blog.goethe.de/BLNRB/ "BLNRB").

These talented folks got on a plane and flew all the way out to Nairobi, Kenya and started something incredible. Teaming up with local talent from Kenya... Living, working, making music and performing all together in one space, now dubbed the Madhouse, BLNRB went from an idea into some incredibly interesting music.

The album "BLNRB - Welcome to the Madhouse" features 18 original recordings which in turn feature more than 20 artists spread over the tracks. The album is a perfect culmination of high tech west with the love and passion of Africa... a new sound, something uniquely different.
