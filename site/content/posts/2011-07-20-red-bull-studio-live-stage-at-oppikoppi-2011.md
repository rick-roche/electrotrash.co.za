The full line-up of music at this year’s stage at Oppikoppi Unknown Brother, along with the sound and visuals, promises to be a non-stop sonic roller-coaster exploring the full spectrum of what the South African electronic music scene has to offer.

Last year’s Red Bull Studio Live Stage at Oppikoppi 2010 set a precedent for all those hungry for a sound supreme and this year’s stage at Oppikoppi Unknown Brother 2011 is once again set to become a mecca of all things machine. The full line-up of music from Friday the 5th to Sunday the 7th of August, along with the sound and visuals, promises to be a non-stop sonic roller-coaster exploring the full spectrum of what the South African electronic music scene has to offer. From the deep, soulful House stylings of Pretoria natives Sisco and Jullian Gomes going to back to back, to the gnarly grind of Joburg Thrash-Electro darlings, Double Adapter, to a set by local legend, Vinny Davinci for his distinctive breed of vocals and thump, revellers will never be short of music to move their bodies to. There will also be a healthy dose of low-slung Electronica and bass from Binary, Card On Spokes and newcomer Oltak, alongside the relentless Drum 'n Bass pedigree provided by Hyphen and Niskerone topped off by stellar live performances by of the thugged-out groove maestro , Sibot, and the booty in outerspace Rap-duo, Sedge Warbler. As South African electronica and dance roots itself ever more firmly into the global garden of beats and sonics, the Red Bull Studio Live Stage aims to present the pioneers of the local scene at their best, making a truly world-class festival dancefloor.
