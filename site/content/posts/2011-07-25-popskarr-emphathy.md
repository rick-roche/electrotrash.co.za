Popskarr are back with a brand new singled entitled _Empathy._ In true Popskarr style, it has all the elements of their brand of Electro-Pop that we have come to love. _Empathy_ is a free promo release for their upcoming EP to be released in the near future. While you wait for the EP to be dropped, grab _Empathy_ below and put it on repeat, because this song is sex!
