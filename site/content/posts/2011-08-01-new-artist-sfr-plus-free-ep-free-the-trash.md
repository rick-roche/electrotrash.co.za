Adding a new face to the Electrotrash family this week, we have SFR all the way from Cape Town. As a producer of all things BASS, SFR has been doing his thing for the past 7 years, culminating in a numnber of international releases in the UK and US. Check out his artist page [here](/artists/sfr/) for social media links and more info on this talented producer.

For a bit of his flavour download his aptly named _Feed the Trash_. Grinding, face-melting bass and huge drums. Yes please!

On top of all the international releases, he has also found time to produce a killer EP entitled _Difference in Detail_, which is available as a free download from his website: [www.djsfr.com](http://www.djsfr.com/)! The EP is full of bass heavy, dance-floor fillers that really pack a punch! Grab the EP on his website after giving it a listen below.
