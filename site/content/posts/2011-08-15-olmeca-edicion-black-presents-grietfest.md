Over the last two and a half years, **GRIET** has brought you over 100 events including the **Pyramid** and **Dome** stages for the past two **RAMFESTS**. Our stages have hosted some of the worlds leading dance music acts such as HAEZER, Le Castle Vania (USA), Double Adapter, Cyberpunkers (ITALY), DJ Antention (RUSSIA), Mr Sakitumi, Tom Deluxx (FRANCE), Saint Pauli (GERMANY), Yesterday’s Pupil, Lark, Kidofdoom, Desmond & the Tutus, P.H.fat, and more…

Our parties aim to be world-class dance events featuring the latest in music, sound, lighting, visuals and high level production standards. So it comes as no surprise that in August 2011 GRIET now brings you the first ever electro festival in South Africa: **GRIETFEST!**
