WhoKilledJR's latest remix is pure sex. From his trademark slap-bass, to the stabby power-chord synths, this remix features all the elements which have been missing from the recent onslaught of chainsaw electro. Not to worry though, because although distortion is kept at subtle levels, this track packs quite a punch. Give this track some love and grab the download below. You may just be looking at an official remix for the next Hearts Revolution single.
