This is the second installment in a series of mixes [JakobSnake](http://www.facebook.com/pages/JakobSnake/205605989458900) is doing in promotion of his AFROCLAP parties. The focus here is on rhythm with percussion and syncopated beats playing leading roles. South American and African influences abound. This mix has a more kwaito flavour and features a number of local tracks and remixes. In his own words:

> This mix is a lot more Kwaito-centered, a lot of local and international guys making some of my favourite music, including Jumping Back Slash, Das Kapital, SBTRKT Richard the Third and Seiji.
>
> I made it a little more "smooth" than the last one...something to run to, or jack in, in the background...its still super BASSIVE though and best heard on a great soundsystem or in headphones :)

This is a great start to the weekend. Download it, pump it and dance!
