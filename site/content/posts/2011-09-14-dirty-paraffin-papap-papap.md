Our friends over at [Andile's Bored Company](http://andilesbored.com/2011/09/02/papap-papap/) put me on this track by Jozi based [Dirty Paraffin](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dirty-Paraffin/126487024055303) a little while back, but since their [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/dirty-paraffin) page was maxed I had to wait a few days until they could send me a copy of the track for your downloading pleasure. Dirty Paraffin is fresh and original. Their sound is unmistakably local and unique. We'll be bringing you a full bio on the boys in the near future, but in the mean time grab their celebration of Friday nights below. Also be sure to check out [Andile's Bored Company](http://andilesbored.com/). They might be the new kids on the blog, but damn, they got flavour.
