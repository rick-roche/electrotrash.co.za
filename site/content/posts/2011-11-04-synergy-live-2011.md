[Synergy Live 2011](http://synergylive.co.za/) has been billed as the event that closes the year in style, and with 100 bands, DJ's & Comedians confirmed and Black Rebel Motor Cycle Club as main stage headliner Synergy Live 2011 has once again proven why it is a force to be reckoned with.

And it doesn’t end there! The electro outfit F.O.O.L has just been announced as headlining the electro stage! The Swedish DJ’s and producer consisting of Rasmus Hermansen and Oliver Nillsson duo have revolutionized the electronic music scene worldwide. Ever since the release of their debut EP Diamond Ashy Lungs (2009) not only has F.O.O.L become a household name, they have travelled the world and for the first time will be playing in our continent and at the greatest summer festival, Synergy Live 2011.

Also blazing the electro stage is the Brazilian duo made up of Marcus aka Jim and Eduardo aka Du as **_Dirtyloud._** One of the hottest new electronic acts to emerge in 2010, **_Dirtyloud_** can count David Guetta and a slew of headline DJs among their fans, as they continue to kick out the jams from their studio in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Their jacking, tough yet effortlessly groovy sound has come to define the nu-electro style currently taking the world by storm. Their assault on the sales charts on Beatport is just short of legendary, having up to 4 tracks at any one time in the top 10 electro-house chart, and having sat at no.2 on Beatport “all genre chart” for weeks at a time, their position as the purveyors of the most cutting edge house in the world today has been cemented.
