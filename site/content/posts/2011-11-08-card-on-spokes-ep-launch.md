This Saturday sees the release of new EP by Cape Town based producer and instrumentalist Shane Cooper aka Card On Spokes. The EP, entitled _In You Go_, features seven tracks written and produced by Card On Spokes and mixed by Sibot and Dank, two household names in the Cape Bass scene. Final mastering was done by Matthew de Nobrega, whom some of you might remember from Unit.r. Having listened to the EP on repeat for a while now, I can honestly say that it is one of the best productions I have heard this year and not just locally!

The launch is presale only and will be held at a secret location (hint, it's not your usual venue) the details of which will be revealed once you buy a ticket. You can buy tickets either online at [Quicket](https://www.quicket.co.za/ViewProduct.aspx?productid=230) or from DR Pachanga  - 210 on Long Mall (Bloem Street entrance) for R50 or  R80 with a pre-order CD you'll recieve on the night. Supporting acts for the evening are Mr Sakitumi, Hyphen, Dank, Jakob Snake and DJ Radbeatz. Besides great music, there will also be food on offer and table tennis. Hellfire will be bringing the sound and lighting so things should look and sound awesome. The launch starts at 5PM and ends at midnight, which means you party monsters out there can hit the clubs afterwards.  See you there!
