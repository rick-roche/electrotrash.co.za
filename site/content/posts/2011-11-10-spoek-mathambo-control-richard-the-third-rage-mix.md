Control is one of my favourite tracks off of Spoek Mathambo's album _Mshini Wam_. The bass is deep, as are the vocals, which gives it a feeling of good 90s deep house. The drums programming on the other hand is very afro-tech and the contrast really works. Richard the Third takes full advantage of this contrast, building on the tracks minimal structure and bringing a remix that is large and ready for the dance floor. With jacked up bass and drums and added synths, this remix is another solid production from Richard the Third. Grab it below!
