Following on from the gleeful, hurricane stages at Oppikoppi and Rocking the Daisies, the Red Bull Studio Live returns for the third time this year at the mammoth Synergy Live music festival, once again providing the electronica and dance music fodder for the frothing, festival revellers. SA's pedigree Drum n Bass, Electro, Glitch-Hop, Dubstep and Downbeat producers such as Niskerone, Double Adaptor, PHfat, Mix n Blend, Mr. Sakitumi and many more will be joined by the likes of expert, international Grinding Electro dons, Dirty Loud and F.O.O.L., up and coming prolific, wunderkind, Das Kapital and a Sunday line-up featuring some of the best DJs from CT's freshest new party, Cold Turkey. In the words of the festival organisers themselves, "If the main stage is the heart of Synergy, the Red Bull Studio Live stage is definitely its feet…"
