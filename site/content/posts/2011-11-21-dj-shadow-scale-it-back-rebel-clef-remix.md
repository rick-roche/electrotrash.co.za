Rebel Clef has just dropped his remix of the new DJ Shadow single _Scale it Back_ featuring Little Dragon. It is his entry into the remix competition, which closes on the 25th of November. Taking the raw sound of the original, he wraps it in a warm blanket of smooth bass and soft touches of the keys. The vocals ooze sex and the remix reflects this mood, dripping sexuality like melting butter.
