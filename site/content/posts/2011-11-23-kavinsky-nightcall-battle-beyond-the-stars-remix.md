A year in the making, this remix is the latest from Cape Town based producer Battle Beyond the Stars. Although rough versions of this track were floating around, I am glad we waiting for the final product, because it is a polished gem. Focusing on the whispy vocals of Lovefoxxx, this remix brings out the sultry elements of the track, while shoving hththe French Touch out of the way. The song starts with a muted guitar and simple bass that opens up into a soundscape filled with touches of keys and deep pads. The lead is slightly distorted, which adds a bit of crunch to the smooth peanut butter like texture of the track. Grab the download and leave your comments below.
