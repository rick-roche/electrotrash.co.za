Released today, Boss is the latest single from [Richard The Third](http://thirdworldfromthesun.wordpress.com/). We really loved the track when he first released the teaser. In his words the single is:

> "mix up the sounds of Purple Funk with local Kwaito Flava, collaborating with Alexandra Township emcee and singer, **Rebone**. The track “Boss” is straight up dancefloor bizniss featuring wobbly synth leads, bashing drums and township swaggering rap. The single also features a hyper-drum smashing remix by SA Dubstep king, [SFR](http://www.djsfr.com/) and a low-slung, narcotic thug-hop remix by the up-and-coming prolific [Das Kapital](http://www.facebook.com/kid.kapital) alongside the syncopated, Afro-Tech quirky “Pilchards” on the digital flip."
