The new fully customised 12m long I\*> WHEELS truck will also be joining the party with its entertainment area including a mobile concept store inside the truck.  The Cold Turkey crew have made sure the food vibes will be as tasty as a Sunday Braai!  There are also some other surprises installed for the good folks of Cape Town.
