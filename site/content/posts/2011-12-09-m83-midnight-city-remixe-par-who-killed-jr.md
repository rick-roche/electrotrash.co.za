With his latest remix, Who Killed JR takes the moody, dreamy _Midnight City_ by M83 out of its after hours club feel and injects some 2am energy. With the piano intro, he adds an accoustic touch. Jacking the bass and drums up a notch, and gating the main synth gives the track that WKJR feel while staying faithful to the _leitmotiv_ of the original. Nuff said, grab it!
