Oxblood is Cape Town producer Robin Brink. He as put together a mix of his unreleased demo tracks as well as produced a slick, projection based video for his track Subequator Loop, which showcases his work with the Lightworks collective. Glitch and breaks, as well as playful melodies are the foundation on which this music is built. Straddling the line between instrumental hip hop and electronic music, Oxblood is definitely one to watch in 2012. We here at electrotrash are really looking forward to what this talented producer has on offer. For a short bio check out his artist page [here](/artists/oxblood/).
