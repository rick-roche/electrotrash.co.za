> The Cape Town Electronic Music Festival (CTEMF) is the celebration of a scene coming of age. It marks the point at which the Electronic Music Scene in South Africa has been recognized by itself and beyond as an industry that has reached the state of being self-sustainable.
>
> The CTEMF is not about how many feet pass through the door, its not about booking the biggest acts to ensure radio play or getting as many 'likes' on facebook as possible. It's about communicating the ethos, passion and musical creativity that has driven the scene from its early days to its current position as a global player in the world of electronic music.
