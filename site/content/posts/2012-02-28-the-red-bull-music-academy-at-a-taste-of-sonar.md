This year the **Design Indaba** brings the Barcelona-based **Sónar Music Festival**, one of the highlights on the European music calendar, to Cape Town. **"A Taste Of Sónar"** will feature Global Electronica heavyweights such as **Modeselektor** and **Brodinski** share the stage with local Electronic Music masters such as **Das Kapital** and **Fletcher in Dub**during DesignIndaba 2012.

As an addition to **"A Taste Of Sónar"** the **Red Bull Music Academy** will host a stage featuring past Red Bull Music Academy participants such as **Culoe De Song** and **Jullian Gomes**. This is in line with Sónar's ongoing collaboration with the Red Bull Music Academy  which began in 2005 with the Red Bull Music Academy team curating the **SónarLounge** Stage which moved up in 2009 to the **SónarDôme** Stage, at Sónar by Day.

Many of the past South African Red Bull Music Academy participants have had the opportunity to play at Sónar such as **Black Coffee**, **Culoe De Song**, **Jullian Gomes,** **T-Man** and **Richard the Third**, giving them exposure to international audiences. One of South Africa's most successful House Music artists, **Black Coffee**, played a legendary closing set at the SonarLounge, as the Barcelona sun set and the Sonar by Day crowd were awed by Coffee's infectious and refined Afro rhythms and 4/4 kicks. His set was echoed some years later when Black Coffee's protege, **Culoe De Song**, closed the SónarDôme to over a thousand revellers who lapped up the young prodigy's haunting Tribal House.

It is no surprise then that "**A Taste Of Sónar"** will feature a Red Bull Music Academy Stage featuring the aforementioned Culoe De Song and Jullian Gomes, last year's Red Bull Music Academy participant, the eclectic Electronica master **Behr**, as well as other past participants and local pioneers such as **Thibo Tazz**, **Terrence Pearce** and **Rebel Clef**. With the addition of the Red Bull Music Academy Stage, **"A Taste Of Sonar"** will  truly be one this year's best Electronic and Dance Music Events in South Africa.

**“A Taste of Sónar”** will take place at Cape Town’s City Hall on Friday 2 March 2012.
