Just over 3 weeks to apply for the Red Bull Music Academy 2012, hosted in the city that never sleeps; New York. There is just over 3 Weeks until the end of the Application Phase of this year's Red Bull Music Academy (RBMA) in New York and we need you to spread the word. Having traversed the globe with previous stops including Berlin, Toronto, London, Madrid, Melbourne, and Cape Town among others, the Red Bull Music Academy is excited to be landing in New York for 2012. Music makers of all styles, methodologies and levels of experience are invited to apply until April 2, 2012, for what will be a once in a lifetime opportunity. One of the most iconic cities on the planet, NYC has been immortalized in the pantheon of music - incubating genres like hip hop, disco, house, bop, no-wave, and post-punk among others. NYC is inspiration central: a place where people from all nations collide, bringing music, culture, and attitude with them. Music is everywhere, from cars cruising the block banging hip hop mix shows to the indie rock stars of tomorrow mashing drums in East Village practice spaces. Boomboxes blasting Willie Colón soundtrack outdoor domino games, and hipster troubadours play fiddles in the subway while kids shout the words to the latest A$AP Rocky single down the train aisles. After all, nothing’s equivalent to the New York state of mind. The Red Bull Music Academy is excited to become part of this sonic kaleidoscope this year. From September 30 through November 2, 2012, the world-travelling music lab and festival will set up shop in the city for five weeks' worth of workshops, concerts, club nights, and all-round musical extravaganzas held all across the boroughs, held over two terms. Past South African Red Bull Music Academy Alumni include Black Coffee, Thibo Tazz, Culoe du Song and Jullian Gomes who are all thriving in their respective genres of music.
