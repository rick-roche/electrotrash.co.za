With CTEMF less than a week away, the excitement is palpable here at ET HQ. With a line up featuring a whole host of Cape Town and South Africa's hottest DJs spread across three days, CTEMF is set to be the premier South African urban music festival. Tickets are available at [Webtickets](http://www.webtickets.co.za/Event.aspx?itemid=379138018) for only R200, giving you access to theÂ roof of the Breakwater Parking Garage at The V&A Waterfront for all three days. For the broke readers out there, we are giving away 5 pairs of tickets. To stand a chance of winning simply send an email to [freeshit@electrotrash.co.za](mailto:freeshit@electrotrash.co.za) with your name and the name of your partner. Winners will be chosen at random and notified via email. One entry per person, competition closes 26th March 23:59. Good luck!
