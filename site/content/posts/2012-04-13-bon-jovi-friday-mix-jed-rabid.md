Listen to this mix by Cape Town based Bass producer Jed Rabid and let us know what you think. Who is Jed Rabid?

> The FBI is currently investigating Jed Rabid for subliminal messages and as a society threatening cult.
>
> Jed Rabid's music can be described as dark and moody with beautiful melodic content and attention to detail. His music is a freestyle mixture of different beat and bass genres, and has a "journey" quality to it.
>
> It was through experimenting with mind altering substances that Jed found his love for electronic music. After going out to clubs and then coming home, Jed would be too wired to sleep and would spend the rest of the morning in front of his computer experimenting and playing with sounds.
