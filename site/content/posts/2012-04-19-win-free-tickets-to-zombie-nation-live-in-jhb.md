> Munich based DJ and producer Zombie Nation (Florian Senfter) hardly needs an introduction. As the mastermind behind one of the most influential electronic records of all-time, Kernkraft 400, Zombie Nation “essentially sleeps on a pillow filled with street cred”. His sound crosses the rift between techno and electro with a power, style and musicality matched by few others.
>
> It was with his highly acclaimed third album ʻBlack Toysʼ (2006), and with his analogue and hardware based production techniques, that Zombie Nation established this signature sound. Said Rob Crossan for BBC Music on his 2009 album ‘Zombielicious’, “With Daft Punk on an extended hiatus and with the echo of Kraftwerk always in his music's vicinity, Senfter's sound is needed more than ever at this time. After a decade of making such a seductive racket, Zombielicious marks a career peak which dazzles and grinds in equally exciting measure.” Album no 5 is currently halfway towards completion…
>
> Zombie Nation is also one half of ZZT, a floor-shaking, synth-grinding electro project in collaboration with Tiga, aptly described by Mixmag as the welcome antithesis to the Guettification of dance music. 2011 saw the release of ZZT’s first album Partys Over Los Angeles, receiving 5 stars in the same Mixmag review.
>
> Zombie Nation’s original and collaborative productions (as ZZT) have been remixed and reworked by the likes of Justice, Erol Alkan, DJ Mehdi, Étienne de Crécy, Yuksek, Siriusmo, Julio Bashmore, Boris Dlugosh, Hey Today!, Housemeister, Fukkk Off, Gesaffelstein, Proxy, Afrojack, Bart B More and Harvard Bass amongst others, and have also featured in all three volumes of the Radio Soulwax ‘Under The Covers’ series.
