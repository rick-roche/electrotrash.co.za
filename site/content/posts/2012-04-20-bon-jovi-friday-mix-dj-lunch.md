Our good friend Data Takashi runs an awesome party at Kitchener's Carvery in Jhb; It's called Style Vs Sound (Style vs Fashion & Broaden A New Sound presents) which is a monthly party on the last Thursday of every month throwing down pop-up sweat shops & future bass booty shaking!

Ri asked for folks to drop of mixes if they wanted to play and LUNCH stepped up and impressed the whole lot of us!

So grab LUNCH's mix below and then head on over to the next Style Vs Sound next Thursday (16 April 2012) and have a great night out!
