Tannhäuser Gate is the new synth heavy project of Wild Eyes members Gareth Dawson and Len Cockraft. Featuring a geargasmic, all analog setup - which includes a Korg MS20 &  MS2000, a Roland JP-8000 and Yamaha CS15 sequenced on an Electribe and an Akai MPC 1000 - their sound is remiscent of the Electroclash sound of the early 2000s, itself a throw back to 80s electro and new wave. With an upcoming release on the US based Flexi Wave record label and already performing a fully live show, 2012 is bound to be a massive year for this duo. Keep your eyes peeled for gigs and listen to their latest demo track below.
