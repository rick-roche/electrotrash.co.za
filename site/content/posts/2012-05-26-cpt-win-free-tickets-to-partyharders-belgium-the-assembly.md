> The PARTYHARDERS have built a solid reputation in their home city of Liege and over the past year to not only become one of the hottest electro names in Belgium, but also the rest of Europe. The electro-wizards and graphic artists (for Ed Banger amongst others) have played in almost all of Europeâ€™s trendy clubs and with artists like Justice, Busy P, Crookers, Boys Noize and The Bloody Beetroots.
>
> Each week they travel to Paris to reside in the famous Social Club. Another highlight was the raving Partyharders vs. The Subs single, 'The Pope of Dope' (Lektroluv), with which they bombed festivals like Pukkelpop, I Love Techno, Lowlands, and more. Their sound is a mindblowing mix of electro, rave and thumping dubstep bass.
>
> Now for the first time this June, THE PARTYHARDERS bring their extraordinary partying to SOUTH AFRICA! Joining them is Highbloo, their Lektroluv labelmate and member of The Subs/Partyharders crew. Be sure to catch them at the following venues:
