It all starts with the _mysterious_ you. Standing beside the body of the _curious_ we never seem to touch. Walking close enough for you to know that _it_ is there and yet nothing can prepare you; there is zero you can do about the _cherry-strange_. So welcome to [Tomorrow Never Happened](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Tomorrow-Never-Happened/249686735087484 "Tomorrow Never Happened"). Bass. Feel. Color.

So here; my crimson _cherry-strange_ adventure-game begins. My day started off filming a Graffiti artist, [Jestr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jestr_sa/ "Jestr"). I never expect anything behind the lens. I just go! One bridge, channel, soar, _mini_\-RIVER and through shit I traveled with this gumboot man. Following him with all my gear in lime green gumboots. One step after the other; into a mesh of the old school : **_HIP-HOP_**_\-pot-_a-mized Graffiti!

The spray-cans started…click, szzzzzzz, kaka! Only you on _this stage_, but sound-color-spray. I look at it and think; it can never be duplicated or even understood.  Yet it does make you feel and that is hidden in secret places. Welcome to party of the whreal; a realization! A scenic, pictorial Pretoria’s underground we live _above_. I never knew of. Party time!

I walk into a zone at [Arcade Empire](http://www.facebook.com/ArcadeEmpire "Arcade Empire") of projected blocks filling my face! A beat so sweet as he always does; it even runs in his blood; Kyle Cancella! His transitions sooo smoothly mastered with the edge of a blade that slashes through space. Then you shake your head and make a primal sound. Aaaaahhhh. Whhhoooo. ..the bass runs through you… slooooow change . [Dubsidia](http://soundcloud.com/dubsidia "Dubsidia") (Spain), [Das Kapital](http://soundcloud.com/daskapital "Das Kapital"), [Twelv & Thesis](http://soundcloud.com/twelvandthesis "Twel and Thesis") and [Niskerone](http://soundcloud.com/niskerone "Niskerone") are about to jigSAW your delicate body.

Twelv & Thesis; Oh yes a drink; and then the vibration inspires me, drives my head back to the cubed bass wonder-spot, ever changing. That explodes through my limbs. His sounds are individual characters in a film with no script. Exploring the world of possibility; after many trips down the rabbit hole they bring something new, some**what?** Different. Makes _booties_ shake!

The crowd danced with the pattern of _cherry_ glue, the cube and the blocks of brilliant colors became part of you. Mesmerized, my ears, my eyes. Jason Erasmus; the _video-cubist_ hypnoti**zing**, hypnoti**zing** ! Das Kapital going through a play list of different genres, like kinder-garden cup cakes. Without even blinking, its gone and then; he brings his harp**PING** song…. It’s a fucking jum**PING** Castle!

[Spanish man](http://soundcloud.com/dubsidia "Dubsidia");

There is more to Spain than I _assumed_. Knowing assumptions lead to the _amused and the possibly fucked_. He played like a traveler and the crowd was his back -pack. I like his music; it flows into different cultures so freely. There is this off beat balance in how the bass and the electro speak to one another. A conversation you try to follow, yet the beauty of the moment overwhelms you. Later he just becomes an observer of an _unknown_ crowd, as one, moving to his music. The sound spun like a web around the space; it felt safe. I did not speak. Like walking with spiders; quiet company. But thunder heart!
