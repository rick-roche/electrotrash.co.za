It has been a while since we have had anything from [The Watermark High up on Electrotrash](/tag/the-watermark-high/ "The Watermark High on Electrotrash"). In the time that has past [the band](/artists/the-watermark-high/ "The Watermark High") has simply become the alias of Johannesburg based experimental electronic musician, Paul van der Walt.

Paul has crafted a 5-track EP entitled "Slow Motion Clarity" and released it using [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/ "Bandcamp")'s "Name-Your-Price" option, which allows you to buy the album for as much (or as little) as you like!

I really recommend grabbing this one, it is a smooth, uplifting experience that makes my days stuck behind a desk feel like I am still outside, rocking it! A review will be up soon!
