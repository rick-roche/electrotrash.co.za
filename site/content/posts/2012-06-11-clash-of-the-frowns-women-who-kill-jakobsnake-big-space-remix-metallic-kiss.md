A clash of The Frowns. Both mixes hot as fuck with their own swag. While the one sounds a little more sorded than evil the other strikes back with the hard thrash to make your ears bleed.

Women who kill takes a darker tone and leaves an eerie kind of bone chilling guilty pleasure sensation running through your loins reminding that fornication is indeed a sin. That buss bump is the kinda boot knocking to make your neighbors complain, bump bump bump on the hump hump hump hump followed by the aural release of pleasure. Unless you’ve got hands over each other’s mouths don’t try keep the noise down! This is fuck music!

Jakbosnake comes at you straight to make your mind bug. From one side of the ear phones to the other he makes your head spin looking around while Lucifer’s bassline snakes around and rears it’s head in front of you. The beat keeps you in a trance and reminds you that if there was to be a heaven versus hell party, no one except harp playing, Mozart loving, snow flake motherfuckers would be trying to get down to Stevie Wonders ebony and ivory upstairs. HELL IS WHERE THE PARTY IS AT! Clash of the Frowns what side you standing on?
