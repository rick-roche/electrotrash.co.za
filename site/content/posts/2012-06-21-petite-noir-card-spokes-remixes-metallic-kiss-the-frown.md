Card on Spokes adds analog warmth to the mix ,with little squelches and bleeps popping up now and then and a little synth solo that pulls it all together. The drum programming gives the track a feeling of urgency that contrasts well with the drawn out vocals.

In the other corner we have Petite Noir with a spooky, spacey remix. Arps and pads set the mood, with a thereminesque lead on the melody and muted drum, triplets on the hats and snare rolls completing the rhythm.
