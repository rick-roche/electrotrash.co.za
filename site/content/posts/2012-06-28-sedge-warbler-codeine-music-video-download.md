[![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/scan-e1340874434880.jpg "sedgewarbler")](/2012/06/28/sedge-warbler-codeine-music-video-download/scan/) Sedge Warbler is back with new video for their track _Codeine_. Shot at OppiKoppi 2011 by STZFX it follows an inebriated Disco as he tries to find his way on stage. The track is classic Sedge Warble, with a punchy bass laying the foundation for the numerous glitches and squeaks and Disco's hard hitting verses. Check the video and hit the download link to grab the track.
