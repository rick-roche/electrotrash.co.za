Audiophile021's latest release is entitled Triola, out now on Triplefire Music. A two track EP, which sees this Cape Town producer and DJ enter new territory. Unlike his other releases, this one is pure 4 on the floor techno goodness. Minimal and moody, the groove of the title track lies in the bassline. Slightly more uptempo and dancefloor oriented, _Red vs. Blue_ is another quality production. Preview the EP below and buy it on beatport!
