We haven't had an electro banger on the blog in a while, so the track _WTF!!_ by Cape Town producer ORIHALCON is a nice change of pace. In his own words, it is a "mix of electro-fidget (or some shit) that mixes into a drumstep/ dubstep vibe track. Low and heavy basses mixed with some high-end stuff with a tempo change from 130-160bpm". Call it what you want, but this track is perfect for friday nights at The Assembly. As always you can grab it below.
