[Little Light Blue](https://soundcloud.com/littlelightblue) has just dropped a new album full of dubstep/electro ready for the dancefloor. Filled with high energy basslines, stabbing synths and pounding drums that make you wish it were weekend, this is not sit down and listen on your headphones music, rather movement is required!Â  So put your shuffle shoes on and grab the title track (and the whole album) below.

You can get the whole album here: https://www.mediafire.com/?jv9dx3tfas9djdd
