Jozi based producer [Veld](https://soundcloud.com/veld) makes beautiful electronic music. More recently his focus has been on the deeper side of house as his two productions _AP Slender_ and _a deed_ show. The off-time wobble over a deep gro0ve of _AP Slender_ will make it a dance floor favourite.

The afro-tech rythms of _a deed_ make it more upbeat, but vicious synth stabs and a slightly detuned organ leave you feeling slightly unsettled.
