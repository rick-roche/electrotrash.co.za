[![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gay-thing-Poster-2-copy1-671x1024.jpg "Gay thing Poster 2 copy")](/2012/08/09/gay-thing-party-party/gay-thing-poster-2-copy-2/) [Gay Thing](https://soundcloud.com/gaything) are Evert Snyman and Louise Eksteen and as the name suggests, produce fun, campy electro-pop. Party Party is their first release leading up to their set at Grietfest, with more to come fortnightly! _Party Party_ is described as a pre-coital song and it definetly fits the bill. Porno synths, an arped bassline and vocals in falsetto set the tone. This is an act to watch and if you have the chance do so. It'll be a party!
