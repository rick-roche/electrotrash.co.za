women who kill brings the Bass with his laid back ode to the olympics. In his own words:

> Whilst watching the Olympics, Men's Hammer throw final to be exact, the one commentator tripped over his words so badly. Luckily I managed to record the sample.
>
> This track was born last night at 2am when two cats decided to go buckwild right outside my window, so I decided to write them a little love-making number using the commentator's stumble.
>
> You need headphones or proper speakers for this one.
