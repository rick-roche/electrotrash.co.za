I find myself traveling on a gravel road, _bouncing_ up and down on the synthetic leopard-fur-covered seat. This neon taxi traveling through the unknown lines of a **_town-ship_** tale. Surrounded by the scenery of the ever so catchy [kwaito](http://www.sahistory.org.za/performing-arts/kwaito "Kwaito") **beast** chasing the sexiness of my seat. Head pop, hip swirl, this bounce art beats to the rhythm of our African soul. Deep layered kicks covering the base of the ground, which this reverberation of a journey travels sound.  Subterranean from within a fire explodes! A rather ancestral celebration of the **_Eclectro_** is complete. One foot stomp to the ground – tap that b**AAAAAS**ss – back down, back down from this boss. Keep to the left, cross... that red light, tap thrice, to evoke the creature of _night_.

In the backseat, light panning crusts crumbles to this **_Afro-Dust_**. This taxi-space ship, now, takes off.  Reflective sounds in-house water dancing delicately off a cosmos of sardines moments before it gets **_Pilchard_**. Rhythmic choppy palpitating waves. Love the panning sunny side up, subtle little rushes in the back.  The build-up is a District9-Yoda on acid – eerie lows and highs with this sarcastic synth; left wing _pass_enger seat. So abrupt this **Oh-9-Yoda** speaks! This mind’s got attitude yo! OOOH!!! Adventure strikes, psychedelic visuals shoot their bows through this leopard-crow. Something slightly dark creeps in. Takes your brow up and down – head-throb-bob refined by the drrr-**_UUHMS_**; kick back, drop, **HI**p h**OP**, st**OP**. Hit **IT**.

Slowly these [_Black Porcelain_](http://www.beatport.com/track/slip-feat-black-porcelain-original-mix/3682713 "Slip ft Black Porcelain") mermaids sing their stories in vibrating rings around your heart. Deep - **SUB**marine - **house** 50 frames per second with a slap of _Berlin filter_ that stretches and flows. [Spikiri](http://yomzansi.com/tag/mandla-spikiri/ "Spikiri") lights his ci**garrrrr** to "_[Ufanani](http://www.beatport.com/track/ufunani-feat-the-ruffest-original-mix/3682709 "Ufunani ft the Ruffest") ft [The Ruffest](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ruffest/142518409149807 "The Ruffest")_". **Afreeeeeek** got **_bongo-bongo_**! OG of sugar _can-feeds_. Now close your eyes for a moment as [Sibot](http://www.sshadoworkss.co.za/artist/sibot "Sibot") would say - transcend... losing your 8th sight in mind of your Oh-9-Yoda, a sound that projects a flashing light. Bird like, its _seams_, these noises that form shapes, characters in your centre mind dreams. Sound reminiscent of old black and blue cartoons hitting the side of shack shape piece of metal – open whole illumination; an African mythology discovery? Those lyrics, vocals kill me. Ladies bringing soul into this mythical **_Eclectro_**.

Abstract distortion, imagine an **U**t**OP**ia of cartoon workers in a coco factory; rhythmically off sync, moving like melting chocolate over a conveyer belt of **_Afro-Dust_** **_cakes_**. This scent intoxicates you, your back is now comfortable and the fur-covered seat w**_raps_** you round like the spots do a leopard. This organic vehicle she speaks.. Oh-9-Yoda. A flash of **NEO-ON** and a rabbit. This time there is no option between blue and red. This **_Afro-Dust_** _Purple **Gold**_ has finally been fed.
