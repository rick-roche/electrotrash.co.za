Dank has just released his brand new EP entitled Camouflange on Skanky Panky records and is available exclusively through [Beatport](http://www.beatport.com/release/camouflange-ep/961522). With 6 tracks that feature the likes of Non (from Shadowhuntaz), Disco Izrael, Cerebral Vortex and Debbie Korck on vocals, and big drums, phat bass and biting leads the EP remains true to the Glitch Hop sound that Dank is known for. Grab a download of the Bathsalts instrumental below and take a gander at the video treatment, created entirely by Non on his iPhone!
