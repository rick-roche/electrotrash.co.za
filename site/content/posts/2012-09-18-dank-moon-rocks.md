> Dank is back with another slab of space thuggery. "Moon Rocks" is bursting with huge jilted kick drums and earth shattering bass sounds. "Moon Rocks" delivers more of the cosmic soundscapes Dank created with his recent "Camouflange EP".

I never understood why people referred to MDMA as Moon Rocks, it's not like it affects your sense of gravity...
