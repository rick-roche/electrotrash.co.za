Battle Beyond the Stars' entry into the Sébastien Tellier remix contest is a tribute to that classic French Touch Tellier helped pioneer, complete with draw-out pads and walking bassline. We've managed to get our grubby paws on it and are offering it up for download. That's right, free and without guilt!
