[![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/gwd.jpg "gwd")](/2012/09/20/gateway-drugs-airwaves-official-music-video/gwd/) The catchy first single of Cape Town based, electro-pop duo Gateway Drugs gets the video treatment courtesy of Xander van der Westhuizen, who nails the nostalgia created by the track. Washed-out colours and double exposure, performance behind the wheel of a car, standing in a smoke-filled room jamming synths: 80s.  \[tags\]Gateway Drugs, Airwaves, Official Music Video, South Africa, Electro-pop\[/tags\]
