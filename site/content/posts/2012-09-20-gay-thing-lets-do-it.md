_Let's Do It_ is the latest release by [Gay Thing](https://soundcloud.com/gaything/). Meant as a final teaser for last weeks Grietfest, we're putting it up now, 'cause I was on holiday. Raunchy and slightly darker than their previous tracks, it nevertheless maintains that Gay Thing we've grown to love, complete with distorted synths, harmonic lead guitar and filthy vocals. In their words: "A post coital song".
