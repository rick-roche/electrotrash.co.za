For the fourth year running the Red Bull Studio Live Stage at Rocking the Daisies promises to deliver a weekend of some of the best Electronica and Dance Music South Africa and the world has to offer.  This year’s line-up will surely have the maddening crowd's arms in the air, feet kicking up grass and jaws dropped to the floor. Here’s who to look out for.

**Koan Sound** are an act that all the Bass-Heads and Gnarly Drumstep lovers will dare not miss. Their quirky and Funk-fuelled take on the Drum ‘n Bass and Dubstep scene make their music and shows larger-than-life, heavier-than-lead and more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

On the flip-side, **Agoria's** genre-defying take on Techno promises to treat those keen on late-night, peak-hour, dance floor business. His sound-design driven, Dub and Acid washed sonics have taken him around the world and earned him a prestigious Fabric Mix. For all those in the mood for some beats and party-rocking nonsense, **DJ Yoda** will be returning to SA with his truly-unique visual Turntablism and pioneering VJ / DJ sets that made his gigs in South Africa some of the most memorable of last year.

And on the topic of Turntablism, DJing and Electronic and Beat Music in general, this year the Red Bull Studio Live Stage is bowled-over-honoured to be hosting the pioneer and one of the inventors of it all, **Grand Master Flash**. His set at Rocking the Daisies commemorates some 40 years of Hip-Hop, Dance and Electronica from around the world and we have Red Bull MOBILE to thank for bringing him to our shores.

This year of course sees the Red Bull Studios continuing efforts to present the best local Electronica and Dance to the festival masses. With a line-up that includes the heavy-weight House styling’s of **Goldfish, Black Motion** and **Leighton Moody**, the thumping Bass of **Pascal & Pearce**, **Twelv & Thesis** and **RudeOne**, the cutting-edge live Electronica of **Christian Tiger School**, **Card On Spokes** and **Dank**, alongside many more, it’s likely that the job is pretty much done.
