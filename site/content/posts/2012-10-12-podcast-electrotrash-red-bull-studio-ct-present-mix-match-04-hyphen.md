Hyphen takes us back to the beginning in this month's episode of Mix & Match. We cover his start in vinyl and how he got his foot in the door, as well as play a selection of tracks that influenced him back in the day and what he's feeling these days. He's shared some great stories with us and his perfect radio voice adds an element of class to the show. Check it out below or download it to listen on the go!
