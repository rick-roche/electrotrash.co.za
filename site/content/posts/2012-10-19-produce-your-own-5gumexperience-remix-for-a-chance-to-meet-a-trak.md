5 Gum South Africa has added an additional sensory experience to its latest #5GumExperience

Follow the steps below to remix and submit your version of A-trak's  "Money Makin". A-trak himself will judge all submissions and the winner and a mate will be flown to a #5GumExperience of their choice – either in Jozi Friday 26 October or Cape Town 27 October – put up in a hotel and get to meet the man himself.

You have until midnight on Tuesday 23 October to submit your track. For the non producers out there, you can still apply for tickets to either event here > [http://bit.ly/W0z7tV](http://bit.ly/W0z7tV)
