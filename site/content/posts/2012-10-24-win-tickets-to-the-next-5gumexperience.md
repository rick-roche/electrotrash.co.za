With four three days to go until the next #5GumExperience and with applications closing here [http://bit.ly/W0z7tV](http://bit.ly/W0z7tV) at midnight on Wednesday, if you haven't already entered, I'm afraid your chances to score tickets to the next gig are dwindling…

But, as always, 5 Gum has come through with a competition to reward you and it's guaranteed to stimulate your senses!

As you know, A-trak and Hudson Mohawke will tear up Jozi and CT this Friday and Saturday respectively and we have a double set of tickets for you to take a mate. All you need to do to get them is send us a pic on Twitter (@electrotrashZA and use the hashtag #5GumExperience) of you with a pack of 5Gum that best depicts Terror Island… The best ones get the tickets.

 Annnd Go! (Competition ends 12:00 \[noon\] 25th october)

Tickets to both events will be mailed by Thursday and blog competition winners will receive theirs by Friday.
