Having reached four chart topping hits on their debut album, five albums later this band’s stage presence and live professional performances is a definitive must see.

> Zander Tyler aka Jack Parow is the quintessential Afrikaans rapper. His laid back lyrical style takes you on a journey of Afrikaans witticism that leaves you heading for the door or laying on the floor with laughter. Either way his impact is undeniable. Synergy Live 2012 will feature Jack Parow as part of the Saturday line up, something definitely not to be missed.

> Francois Van Coke, Wynand Myburgh, Justin Kruger, Jedd Kossew and Jason Oosthuizen make up the band Van Coke Kartel. The Sama winning Bellville contingent is arguably one the best SA rock band’s to come out of South Africa. They have toured extensively internationally playing alongside bands like Muse, 30 Seconds to Mars and Korn to name a few.

> In July this band released their fifth studio album entitled “Evidence”, with their sixth being released on the 29th October, there is no slowing down the iconic Prime Circle. With an impressive list of accomplishments under their belt, Prime Circle has been on the world stages, performed with the greatest rockers of all time and will once again take Synergy Live 2012 to breathtaking heights this summer.

> Once again Redbull Studio Live Stage will be bringing you the best in SA electronica. The likes of Phfat, Haezer, Thibo Tazz, Christian Tiger School, Mix n’ Blend, Hyphen vs SFR
