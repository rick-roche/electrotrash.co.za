Johnny Neon is heading to Germany to spread his brand of death electropop in Europe. As a parting gift he sent us his latest offering entitled _Teenage Sunset_. Typically Johnny, it features an arped bass, sliding synths and drum programming straight out of the 80s. Grab it below and drive into the Sunset!
