Greg Reve is a South African producer whose prolific output of work over the years has made him more of an international underground Bass producer than a local big-fish-in-a-small DJ. Having release some incredible tracks over the years on the mighty Muti Music, either as The Triplet of Bellville, together with rappers Kid Clever and Sinister Dexter as the Realist, or just under the name his parents gave him.

The Red Bull Studio team finally had the chance to touch base (no pun) with Greg a month or two back when he came in to collab with iLL.Gates (more info on that to follow). After chatting, in the true spirit of the share-and-share alike Bass Music scene, Greg gave the Studio his 'Unveilved" EP to upload to the Studio Soundcloud account for free download! What the fuckk... featuring collabs with renowned South African songstress, Tasha Baxter, and alt. Hip-Hop god, Anti-Pop Consortium, its an absolute corker of a release and a true gift to Bass-loving masses this Xmas. Take a listen and download below:
