With the [Cape Town Electronic Music Festival](http://www.ctemf.com "Cape Town Electronic Music Festival") just around the corner, we thought it would be awesome to give away TWO weekend passes to the fest! All you have to do to enter simply send an email to [freeshit@electrotrash.co.za](mailto:freeshit@electrotrash.co.za) and let us know the name of the international guest that will be performing at the festival this year.

Competition closes Monday 11th February 2013 23:59. One entry per person, winners will be chosen at random. Good luck!
